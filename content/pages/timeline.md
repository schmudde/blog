## Joe Rogan Signs With Spotify

Joe Rogan announced an exclusive deal with Spotify that [sent data archivists scrambling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Archiveteam/comments/gmzg5l/joe_rogan_moving_his_show_to_spotify_possible/) to save the media and community discussions surrounding his show on YouTube. The deal is worth more than $100 million according to Anne Steele of The Wall Street Journal, “Spotify Strikes Podcast Deal With Joe Rogan Worth More Than $100 Million.”

## NotPetya Malware Appears

The NotPetya malware first appeared in 2017, on the eve of Ukrainian Constitution Day. It affected thousands of systems in over 65 countries. Maersk, the Danish shipping company, lost $300 million in revenues and was forced to replace 4,000 servers. Even still, Ukraine was the malware’s clear target, suffering 80% of all infections.

## Bret Victor Publishes &ldquo;What Can a Technologist Do About Climate Change?&rdquo;

Midway through *What Can a Technologist Do About Climate Change?*, Victor opines that public discourse on climate relies on “tips, soundbites, factoids, and emotional rhetoric” rather than “evidence-grounded models.” He suggests a solution for working with and discussing profound problems: better tools for model-driven debate, model-driven reading, and model-driven authoring.

## &ldquo;Fuck the EU.&rdquo; Malinformation Effort

An anonymous source posted a conversation between the US Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, and the US Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt. Amidst all the political banter, one line stood out, &ldquo;Fuck the EU.&rdquo; The leaked audio was a crude effort to sow dissension between the US and its EU allies during a tense moment in Ukraine - a move that would clearly help Russian interests.

## Project Minaret at the National Security Agency

&ldquo;The project, which became known officially as Minaret in 1969, employed unusual procedures. NSA distributed reports without the usual serialization. They were designed to look like HUMINT reports rather than SIGINT and readers could find no originating agency. Years later the NSA lawyer who first looked at the procedural aspects stated that the people involved seemed to understand that the operation was disreputable if not outright illegal.&rdquo;

## Bach Writes &ldquo;Herr, gehe nicht ins Gericht mit deinem Knecht&rdquo;

Musical notation falls short of capturing the composer’s intent, the performer’s performance, and the audience’s experience. However, it is the reason we have access to the music of Bach and Beethoven. Musical scores embody information that has traveled through the centuries, slowly and subtly mutating along the way.
