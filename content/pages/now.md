[^now] I'm currently working as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Yorba](https://www.yorba.co/). We are building an open digital identity service. It is currently in private pre-alpha and we're looking to hire people interested in Self-Sovereign Identity, Clojure, and decentralized storage. <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>  [Get in touch](mailto:&#100;&#064;&#115;&#099;&#104;&#109;&#117;&#100;&#046;&#100;&#101;) if that describes you or someone you know.

[^now]: {-} This [*now page*](https://nownownow.com/p/j9Ul) shares what's occupying my time at the moment. If you have your own website, you might want to [create one as well](https://nownownow.com/about). Learn more [about me](/pages/about.html) or read my [CV](/cv.html).

I had the pleasure of being interviewed by [Sara Hurley](https://www.sarahurley.art/) on 18/August. The topic was ‚ÄúThe Art of Up-Cycling Digital Debris‚Äù as part of her on-going *Art of Future* conversation series.

<i class="fa fa-image"></i> [Gallery 404](http://netart.today/), a gallery dealing exclusively in broken digital artworks curated by yours truly, was presented as part of this year's [xCoAx](https://xcoax.org/), the *9th Conference on Computation, Communication, Aesthetics & X*. Read more about Gallery 404 [here](http://www.netart.today/pages/about.html).

I completed my coursework in the [Virtual School on Internet Governance](https://www.virtualsig.org/) a few months ago. The administrator is Glenn McKnight (Canada) and Alfredo Calderon (Puerto Rico) is the Dean of Education.

I completed my contribution to Dick Van Lente's [*Prophets of Computing: Visions of Society Transformed
by Computing*](https://sites.library.queensu.ca/transmissions/computers-and-futures/). My chapter is on Commodore's growth during the mainframe era and its subsequent contributions to personal computing. Now it's in the hands of [ACM and Morgan & Claypool Publishers](http://books.acm.org/). It should be out early next year.

## Projects

I'm still working on two other book projects.

1. Collaborating on an untitled chapter on software preservation with Elisabetta Mori and Patricia Falcao for an edition edited by Liesbeth De Mol: [PROGRAMme Research Into the History and Philosophy of Computing](https://programme.hypotheses.org/). Art will form a cornerstone of our thesis.
2. A secret book project.

## Reading

- *[Fix My Code](https://eeclectic.de/produkt/fix-my-code/)* by Cornelia Sollfrank and Winnie Soon (2021)
- *Essays in Idleness* by Yoshida Kenk≈ç (1332)
- [*Data and Reality*](https://www.bkent.net/Doc/darxrp.htm) by William Kent (1978)
- *Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven* by John Eliot Gardiner (2015)

I just finished *A House in the Mountains: The Women Who Liberated Italy from Fascism* by Caroline Moorehead (2020, [reviewed here](/books/house-on-the-mountains.html)) and *Double Star* by Robert A. Heinlein (1956, [reviewed here](/books/double-star.html)).

## Recent Memory

I've been charting & reporting on COVID-19 cases in Turin, Italy for the last year. I started this local effort because our region was often overshadowed by mighty Milan. But the problem has evolved but I recently retired the notebook: [üáÆüáπ The Corona Virus in Turin, Italy](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/corona-in-italy).

My October talk at *[JupyterCon 2020](https://jupytercon.com/)*, "Dr. Schmood's Notebook of Python Calisthenics and Orthodontia", was [published online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__0Pr13PQSc).[^jupytercon]

[^jupytercon]: Summary: Explore the benefits of taking a functional approach when writing Python in Jupyter notebooks: reduce errors caused by out-of-order execution and hidden state while producing more readable code.

My other talk at [Nexa Center for Internet &amp; Society at the Polytechnic University of Turin](https://nexa.polito.it/mercoledi-133), "Software Preservation in Networked Art", was also recently published. I talk more about the experience in "[Software Preservation in Networked Art](/posts/2020-10-21-software-preservation-networked-art.html)" on *Beyond the Frame*.[^networked-art]

[^networked-art]: Abstract: Art became increasingly abstract and conceptual throughout the 1900s, concluding the century in complete ephemerally on the internet. A brief survey of net art from the 1990s and early 2000s will demonstrate the subsequent challenges faced by many curators and preservationists. Their struggles with the absence of the art object typifies the difficulties of preserving our shared digital heritage. In this way, artists are forced to engage questions that progress-oriented scientists and engineers tend to ignore. The seminar will address the existential questions, current best practices, and future technologies that may help to combat the generational loss of information.
