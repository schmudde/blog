[^now] I am now the proud owner of the domain <http://tegamino.pizza>! This is probably the highlight of my recent work. It's a great place to learn more about this superior type of pizza originating from Turin!

[^now]: {-} This [*now page*](https://nownownow.com/p/j9Ul) shares what's occupying my time at the moment. If you have your own website, you might want to [create one as well](https://nownownow.com/about). Learn more [about me](/pages/about.html) or read my [CV](/cv.html).

## *Windows Into Windows*

I’m wrapping up *Windows into Windows*, an architectual installation for a large LED screen in Turin, Italy called WÔL. The exhibition goes up in October.[^windows]

*Windows into Windows* features a series of historical paintings that mediate the outside world through windows. The images themselves are displayed within computer operating system windows - another mediation. The entire experience is mediated by the distinct visual properties of the WÔL LED screen. The exhibition is a reflection of our increasingly mediated reality.

## Yorba: Account Lifecycles

I continue to do cool stuff with the team at [Yorba](https://yorba.co). I'm working towards publishing our open schema for account lifecycles. It will help people answer questions like "Where are all my subscriptions?" and "Who has all my data?" While this technology originated within Yorba, it's completely open source and based on open standards so you can take your data wherever you go.

What makes this even better is that it attempts to record the provenance of every claim made - essentially acting as an automatic receipt for online activity like account creation or subscription cancellation. Developers can read and trust account histories without being experts in linked data. Auditors can verify deletions to enforce privacy rights. And users get something that finally treats “delete my data” as a first-class action.

We're looking to work with people interested in Self-Sovereign Identity, Clojure, and decentralized storage. <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>  [Get in touch](mailto:&#100;&#064;&#115;&#099;&#104;&#109;&#117;&#100;&#046;&#100;&#101;) if that describes you or someone you know.

## Travel

I stayed in Udine, Italy for the month of August. My wife's father is an Alpinist, which means I've summited my second modest Alpine peak, [Mount Amariana](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2481529512)[^amariana] (my first being [Mount Cogliàns](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1741012298)).

I'm currently preparing for a two week stay in Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm there to work with our friends at [Outside](https://outside.studio/).

## Music

The [new Pixel Grip album](https://pixelgrip.bandcamp.com/album/percepticide-the-death-of-reality) was on constant rotation when it came out. I guess I've been on a bit of a Chicago kick as I'm also spinning a lot of [French Police](https://frenchpolice.bandcamp.com/album/bully). I recently dug out two of my old albums upon request. It was fun to hear *[Idle By Dawn](https://soundcloud.com/schmudde/sets/idle-by-dawn)* and *[Raising Trakl's Fall](https://soundcloud.com/schmudde/sets/raising-trakls-fall)* again in their entirety.


## Reading

My reading list is overflowing, as usual. I recently finished *[Into the Maelstrom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61465147)* by Gordon Cappelletty and Romano Màdera (2022), *White Noise* by Don DeLillo (1985), *Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art* by James Nestor (2020), and *[The Observable Universe](https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/the-observable-universe/)* by Heather McCalden (2024)

I'm currently juggling these books, amoungst a few others:

- *[Road to Nowhere: What Silicon Valley Gets Wrong about the Future of Transportation](https://roadtonowherebook.com/)* by Paris Marx (2022)
- *[In altre parole](https://archive.org/details/inaltreparole0000lahi)* by Jhumpa Lahiri (2015) (my first book in Italian!)
- [*Data and Reality*](https://www.bkent.net/Doc/darxrp.htm) by William Kent (1978)
- The classic *An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise* by John Robinson Pierce (1961)
- *[Prophets of Computing: Visions of Society Transformed by Computing](https://books.acm.org/titles#tab2048)* edited by Dick Van Lente (2022)
- *[48 Laws of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power)* by Robert Greene (1998)

## Recent Memory

### [School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe](https://www.schoolofma.org/news/10yearanniversaryopening) in Berlin, Germany (2024)

The exhibition at Kunstquartier Bethanien featured Gallery 404's latest extension, *The net.art Restoration Project of Gallery 404*.

*The net.art Restoration Project of Gallery 404* presents a vision of what semi-automated cultural preservation might look like. The visitor helps train five screen net.art experience guides visitors through the restoration of a digital artwork from the 1990s. It outsources the difficult labor of restoration to machines to provide dubious results. Machines that moderate our experience of the present today will inevitably mediate our relationship to the past and profoundly impact our understanding of the future. Try it [here](https://www.netart.today/pages/restoration-project.html).

### [xCoAx 2024](https://2024.xcoax.org/) at Fabrica in Treviso, Italy (2024)

I presented *Between Chaos and Order* at the **12th Conference on Computation, Communication, Aesthetics & X** in July.[^xcoax] The abstract:

[^xcoax]: ![xCoAx logo](/img/now/x24xFt.png) xCoAx 2024

> "Between Chaos and Order" delves into the relationship between cryptography and computation, highlighting the place between input and output - the space of computation. Here the dual meaning of “code” is on full display. As *source code* facilitating clarity and order and as a *secret code* meant to feign chaos. In both cases the resulting artifacts have a certain aesthetic sensibility that is only clear through their specific cultural context. This is demonstrated through an examination of three computational artifacts: Edgar Allan Poe’s "The Gold Bug," Alan Turing’s notebook on cracking the Enigma machine, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s publication "Cracking DES." Each object is appraised through the lens of Information Aesthetics as a method of piercing through the technical ingenuity to examine each as an act of human expression. Along the way, this essay asserts the value of certain practices when considering computation as a cultural resource worthy of examination and preservation.
