[^now]Hello from Bertinoro, Italy! I'm here working with the brilliant folks on the [PROGRAMme Research Into the History and Philosophy of Computing](https://programme.hypotheses.org/) project. I'm specifically collaborating on an untitled chapter on software preservation with Elisabetta Mori and Patricia Falcao for an edition edited by Liesbeth De Mol. The preservation of software-based art will form a cornerstone of our thesis.[^preservation]

[^now]: {-} This [*now page*](https://nownownow.com/p/j9Ul) shares what's occupying my time at the moment. If you have your own website, you might want to [create one as well](https://nownownow.com/about). Learn more [about me](/pages/about.html) or read my [CV](/cv.html).

[^preservation]:I covered some of these ideas in my presentation at the [Nexa Center for Internet &amp; Society at the Polytechnic University of Turin](https://nexa.polito.it/mercoledi-133). The video and all related details can be found in *[Software Preservation in Networked Art](/posts/2020-10-21-software-preservation-networked-art.html)* on Beyond the Frame.

Speaking of publishing, I saw the first pre-prints of Dick Van Lente's [*Prophets of Computing: Visions of Society Transformed
by Computing*](https://sites.library.queensu.ca/transmissions/computers-and-futures/). My chapter is on Commodore's growth during the mainframe era and its subsequent contributions to personal computing. The [ACM and Morgan & Claypool Publishers](http://books.acm.org/) have done a great job. It should be out early next year.

The recently published post *[How the Consumer Computer is Consuming Computing](https://schmud.de/posts/2022-08-23-the-consumer-computer.html)* became the most popular post on Beyond the Frame by far. It was featured on the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32636101), the [Redecentralize Digest](https://redecentralize.org/redigest/2022/kthxbye/), and Ghostery's [Privacy Digest 17/22](https://www.ghostery.com/privacy-digest/editions/20220909).

Beyond the Frame has always been concerned with software preservation. [Museums Without Walls](https://www.museusemparedes.com/en/noticia/museums-without-walls-conference-exhibition/) selected [Gallery 404](http://www.netart.today/) - an online gallery curated by your humble author - for exhibition at this year's conference.

*[La guerra dell’informazione è senza limiti (e senza limiti sono le conseguenze)](https://www.qcodemag.it/interventi/la-guerra-dellinformazione-e-senza-limiti-e-senza-limiti-sono-le-conseguenze/)*, the Italian translation of my essay *[Information Warfare Is Without Limits and So Are Its Consequences](https://schmud.de/posts/2022-02-25-info-warfare-without-limits.html)*, has been published by the magazine Q Code! This is an exciting development; I'd like to thank my translator as well as the co-director [Christian Elia](https://twitter.com/eliachr).[^q-code]

Finally, I'm currently working as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Yorba](https://www.yorba.co/). We are building an open digital identity service. It is currently in private pre-alpha and we're looking to hire people interested in Self-Sovereign Identity, Clojure, and decentralized storage. <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>  [Get in touch](mailto:&#100;&#064;&#115;&#099;&#104;&#109;&#117;&#100;&#046;&#100;&#101;) if that describes you or someone you know.

## Reading

I recently finished *[To Catch a Mouse Make a Noise Like a Cheese](https://schmud.de/books/to-catch-mouse-make-noise-like-cheese.html)* by Lewis Kornfeld (1983).

I'm still working through [*Data and Reality*](https://www.bkent.net/Doc/darxrp.htm) by William Kent (1978) and several others.

## Recent Memory

Attended Ink and Switch's *Summit 010 Berlin* and Strange Loop 2022. Both experiences were filled with brilliant folks.

<i class="fa fa-image"></i> [Gallery 404](http://netart.today/), a gallery dealing exclusively in broken digital artworks curated by yours truly, was presented as part of this year's [xCoAx](https://xcoax.org/), the *9th Conference on Computation, Communication, Aesthetics & X*.
