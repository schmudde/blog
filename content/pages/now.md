[^now] I'm excited to announce my new position as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Yorba](https://yorba.co/). We are building an open digital identity service. More details to come.

[^now]: {-} This *now page* shares what's occupying my time at the moment. If you have your own website, you might want to [create one as well](https://nownownow.com/about). Learn more [about me](/pages/about.html) or read my [CV](/cv.html).

I started a class with the [Virtual School on Internet Governance](https://www.virtualsig.org/) in February. The administrator is Glenn McKnight (Canada) and Alfredo Calderon (Puerto Rico) is the Dean of Education. I just finished the first week on internet history, which is centered on the American narrative.


## Projects

<i class="fa fa-image"></i> I continue to curate artworks for [Gallery 404](http://netart.today/). The gallery exhibits net.art as it appears today - exclusively specializing in broken artworks.

My October talk at *[JupyterCon 2020](https://jupytercon.com/)*, "Dr. Schmood's Notebook of Python Calisthenics and Orthodontia", was [published online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__0Pr13PQSc).[^jupytercon]

[^jupytercon]: Summary: Explore the benefits of taking a functional approach when writing Python in Jupyter notebooks: reduce errors caused by out-of-order execution and hidden state while producing more readable code.

My other talk at [Nexa Center for Internet &amp; Society at the Polytechnic University of Turin](https://nexa.polito.it/mercoledi-133), "Software Preservation in Networked Art", was also recently published. I talk more about the experience in "[Software Preservation in Networked Art](/posts/2020-10-21-software-preservation-networked-art.html)" on *Beyond the Frame*.[^networked-art]

[^networked-art]: Abstract: Art became increasingly abstract and conceptual throughout the 1900s, concluding the century in complete ephemerally on the internet. A brief survey of net art from the 1990s and early 2000s will demonstrate the subsequent challenges faced by many curators and preservationists. Their struggles with the absence of the art object typifies the difficulties of preserving our shared digital heritage. In this way, artists are forced to engage questions that progress-oriented scientists and engineers tend to ignore. The seminar will address the existential questions, current best practices, and future technologies that may help to combat the generational loss of information.

I'm still working on three book projects.

1. Collaborating on an untitled chapter on software preservation with Elisabetta Mori and Patricia Falcao for an edition edited by Liesbeth De Mol: [PROGRAMme Research Into the History and Philosophy of Computing](https://programme.hypotheses.org/). Art will form a cornerstone of our thesis.
2. Revising my contribution to Dick Van Lente's [*Prophets of Computing* book](https://sites.library.queensu.ca/transmissions/computers-and-futures/). My chapter is on Commodore's growth during the mainframe era and its subsequent contributions to personal computing.
3. A secret book project.
