I am currently available for contracting.[^now]

- I help cross functional teams develop and coordinate strategies. This includes writing code, analyzing data, and communicating results.
- I am passionate about Clojure/Lisp and Jupyter/Python notebooks.
- I am most interested in initiatives that address the social and ethical issues of our time.

Find out more about me [here](/pages/about.html) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/schmudde). CV available upon request.

## Projects

I am tracking [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ The Corona Virus in Turin, Italy](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/corona-in-italy) using a computational notebook on [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/corona-in-italy).

Launching this blog.

I just completed my contribution to Dick Van Lente's [*Prophets of Computing* book](https://sites.library.queensu.ca/transmissions/computers-and-futures/). My chapter is on Commodore's growth during the mainframe era and its subsequent contributions to personal computing.

A secret book project.

## Reading

- *Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven*
- *Lankavatara Sutra*
