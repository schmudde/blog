## New


- Looking for contracting work.
    - I am looking to work in a cross functional environment where I help research techniques and solutions, communicate and coordinate processes, and write some code.
    - Areas of research include the structure and transmission of information, the social impact of technology, digital art, and the nature of computation.
- Tracking cases in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ The Corona Virus in Turin, Italy](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/corona-in-italy).
- I built this blog.
- A secret book project.
