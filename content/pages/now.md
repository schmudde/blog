[^now] *[La guerra dell‚Äôinformazione √® senza limiti (e senza limiti sono le conseguenze)](https://www.qcodemag.it/interventi/la-guerra-dellinformazione-e-senza-limiti-e-senza-limiti-sono-le-conseguenze/)*, the Italian translation of my essay *[Information Warfare Is Without Limits and So Are Its Consequences](https://schmud.de/posts/2022-02-25-info-warfare-without-limits.html)*, has been published by the magazine Q Code! This is an exciting development; I'd like to thank my translator as well as the co-director [Christian Elia](https://twitter.com/eliachr).[^q-code]

[^now]: {-} This [*now page*](https://nownownow.com/p/j9Ul) shares what's occupying my time at the moment. If you have your own website, you might want to [create one as well](https://nownownow.com/about). Learn more [about me](/pages/about.html) or read my [CV](/cv.html).

I'm currently collaborating on an untitled chapter on software preservation with Elisabetta Mori and Patricia Falcao for an edition edited by Liesbeth De Mol: [PROGRAMme Research Into the History and Philosophy of Computing](https://programme.hypotheses.org/). The preservation of software-based art will form a cornerstone of our thesis.[^preservation]

[^preservation]:I covered some of these ideas in my presentation at the [Nexa Center for Internet &amp; Society at the Polytechnic University of Turin](https://nexa.polito.it/mercoledi-133). The video and all related details can be found in *[Software Preservation in Networked Art](/posts/2020-10-21-software-preservation-networked-art.html)* on Beyond the Frame.

I made several improvements to *Beyond the Frame* in May 2022. I have narrowed the tags to better reflect the blog's focus; I changed #science to [#informatics](/tags/informatics.html) (Informatics and Computer Science) and #humanities to [#sts](/tags/sts.html) (Science and Technology Studies). The site has also seen improvements to the menu and an addition section dedicated to Clojure. The [Subscribe](/pages/feeds.html) page now includes a list of the most popular posts on this blog:

1. [The Mothers of the Mother of All Demos](https://schmud.de/posts/2020-08-04-mother-of-mothers.html)

Finally, I'm currently working as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Yorba](https://www.yorba.co/). We are building an open digital identity service. It is currently in private pre-alpha and we're looking to hire people interested in Self-Sovereign Identity, Clojure, and decentralized storage. <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>  [Get in touch](mailto:&#100;&#064;&#115;&#099;&#104;&#109;&#117;&#100;&#046;&#100;&#101;) if that describes you or someone you know.

## Reading

I recently finished

- *[Nineteen Eighty-Four](/books/1984.html)* by George Orwell (1949)
- *[Getting Started with OAuth 2.0](/books/getting-started-with-oauth.html)* by Ryan Boyd (2012)
- *[Essays in Idleness](/books/essays-on-idleness.html)* by Yoshida Kenk≈ç (~1319-1331)

I'm still working through [*Data and Reality*](https://www.bkent.net/Doc/darxrp.htm) by William Kent (1978) and several others.

## Recent Memory

<i class="fa fa-image"></i> [Gallery 404](http://netart.today/), a gallery dealing exclusively in broken digital artworks curated by yours truly, was presented as part of this year's [xCoAx](https://xcoax.org/), the *9th Conference on Computation, Communication, Aesthetics & X*. Read more about Gallery 404 [here](http://www.netart.today/pages/about.html).

I completed my contribution to Dick Van Lente's [*Prophets of Computing: Visions of Society Transformed
by Computing*](https://sites.library.queensu.ca/transmissions/computers-and-futures/). My chapter is on Commodore's growth during the mainframe era and its subsequent contributions to personal computing. Now it's in the hands of [ACM and Morgan & Claypool Publishers](http://books.acm.org/). It should be out early next year.

I was charting & reporting on COVID-19 cases in Turin, Italy for the last year. I started this local effort because our region was often overshadowed by mighty Milan. But the problem has evolved but I recently retired the notebook: [üáÆüáπ The Corona Virus in Turin, Italy](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/corona-in-italy).

My October talk at *[JupyterCon 2020](https://jupytercon.com/)*, "Dr. Schmood's Notebook of Python Calisthenics and Orthodontia", was [published online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__0Pr13PQSc).[^jupytercon]

[^jupytercon]: Summary: Explore the benefits of taking a functional approach when writing Python in Jupyter notebooks: reduce errors caused by out-of-order execution and hidden state while producing more readable code.
