I was born in Peoria, Illinois [^peoria] and currently live in Turin, Italy.[^turin] The interim years were spent in Iowa &rarr; Chicago &rarr; New York City &rarr; Berlin, Germany.

[^peoria]: Peoria is situated in the Illinois River Valley. The hilly landscape is beautiful and the Rust Belt vibes are strong. ![Peoria skyline](/img/about/peoria.jpeg)
[^turin]: Turin is a peculiar city in the foothills of the Alps. It is part aristocratic and part post-industrial. The myriad of local businesses are a joy to discover. ![Turin skyline](/img/about/turin.png)

I spent the majority of my life working as an artist, a college professor, and a software engineer. My curiosity drives my research, which focuses on the structure and transmission of information, the social impact of technology, digital art, and the nature of computation.

## How I Read

### Books

I always have my nose in far too many books. I prefer eBooks because I often search through my highlights. Furthermore, eInk readers are generally lighter and more ergonomic to use with one hand. They are also a joy to read in daylight and in darkness.

But the vast majority of eBooks are locked down and distributed in a way that is hostile to both authors and readers. I'll write more about this in the future. In the meantime, here are a few ethical sources for eBooks:

- [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) empowers authors and makes the experience joyful for readers.
- [Standard eBooks](https://standardebooks.org/) embody the care and attention that classic books deserve.
- [Tricycle](https://tricycle.org/ebooks/) distributes wonderful books on Buddhism.

### With a Little Help From My Friends

I read blogs and periodicals using an RSS/Atom reader, [Feedly](https://feedly.com/). RSS is a much better way to get your news than social media sites. I also use it to keep track of my friend's writings. Here's a list of friends by subject category - each ordered by how often they post.

- **The Art of Living**: [Khurram Naik](https://naik.co), [The Compass Needle](https://compassneedleblog.wordpress.com), [Meanwhile, Back in Peoria](https://www.meanwhilebackinpeoria.com/)
- **Computing and the Humanities**: [Knowing and Doing](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/index.html), [Veit Heller](http://blog.veitheller.de/), [esoteric.codes](https://esoteric.codes), [Modulo Lotus](http://www.modulolotus.net), [Daniel Bachler](http://danielbachler.de/), [John Jacobsen](http://zerolib.com)
- **Programming**: [Jessitron](https://blog.jessitron.com), [Matt Horan's Blog](https://blog.matthoran.com), [See Spot Code](http://seespotcode.net/)
- **Music &amp; Art**: [Esthetic Lens](http://www.estheticlens.com), [Martina Della Valle](http://martinadellavalle.blogspot.com/), [Travelogue by Jon Sonnenberg](http://artoftravelogue.blogspot.com/), Sharon Hoyer @ [Streetsblog](https://chi.streetsblog.org/author/sharonhoyer/) and [Newcity Stage](https://www.newcitystage.com/), [Nathan Woleck](https://www.nathanwolek.com), [South Street Dungeon](https://southstreetdungeon.wordpress.com)

## How I Do My Computing

![](/img/about/ti-angle.png)

[^how-i-compute] My family's first computer was a Texas Instruments 99/4a (pictured above).[^ti] My grandparents found one at a drastically reduced price during the "home computer wars" circa 1984. Computers have been central to my art practice and intellectual discourse ever since. Here's how it looks today.

[^how-i-compute]: {-} This entry is inspired by Richard Stallman's *[How I Do My Computing](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html)*
[^ti]: I was quite young so all of my time was spent playing games. It was my introduction to BASIC - every TI booted with the programming language as an option. ![TI Software](/img/about/ti.gif) *Some of the software available for the 99 4/a. From [99er](http://99er.net/).*

### My Computer

Most of my hardware decisions are rooted in an effort to source ethical tools. The compromise between ethics and practicality landed me at a [System 76 Lemur](https://system76.com/laptops/lemur) running the [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop) flavor of Linux.

I use an Apple iPhone as a smartphone. I never owned a tablet.

### What I Do On My Computer

Most work begins as text. Lots of research and writing - uncovering concepts, having conversations, and connecting ideas. The work manifests on the web as experiences that span text, music, and video.

### My Tools

I live in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Weechat](https://weechat.org/). The vast majority of what I do on my computer is manipulate text. I switched back to text tools a few years ago. I found that it helps me focus. Since the software is built for text input, they are also much faster to use than mouse-driven programs. It's simple math: ten digits[^mouse] vs. one pointer.

[^mouse]: Well, nine fingers since the spacebar occupies two thumbs.

**Browser**: Firefox with EFF's [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) (desktop), [Brave](https://brave.com/) (mobile), &amp; [EWW](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eww/index.html) (Emacs) - all are set to use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for search.

**eMail**: [Runbox](https://runbox.com) is based in Norway, a country that provides strong privacy regulations. The service is [powered by hydroelectricity](https://runbox.com/why-runbox/sustainable-services/runbox-is-double-carbon-negative/) and endorsed on [Ethical Consumer](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/).

**Messaging**: Weechat gets me to Slack, IRC, Google Chat, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dschmudde), and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@schmudde). So that's where I spend most of my time. On mobile I prefer Signal, but can also be found on iMessage and Whatsapp.[^social]

[^social]: Large proprietary services running on closed protocols introduce a number of concerns. My current response is to limit their use and encourage others to move to better solutions.
