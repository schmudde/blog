Today's internet is largely shaped by a dialog between two ideas. One position considers personal data as a form of property, The opposing position considers personal data as an extension of the self. The latter grants inalienable rights because a person's dignity - traditionally manifested in our bodies or certain rights of expression and privacy - cannot be negotiated, bought, or sold.

The principled stance has largely lost out to the idea that data is a form of property held by the servers where it resides. Even those that oppose personal data held hostage on corporate systems believe that that the solution is private property in another form. Why is the status quo so widely accepted and why is the solution the same system but in another form? After all, the internet itself was created with public money and owned by the public. Today's network is radically different from the one founded decades ago.

# Context

Everything changed in 1991 when the first formal for-profit commercial access to the internet Was sold in 1991 - enabled by a public/private partnership of network operators Merit, IBM, and MCI. 26 [^Merit]

[^Merit]: Merit was A consortium of Michigan Universities tapped to run the internet backbone with IBM and MCI. MCI was a telecom giant that operates large parts of the internet today as Verizon.

But as Ben points out, this commercial internet ownership and access wasn't where the money was. It was only a beachhead.The true trailblazer was the 1978 email. Digital marketing was the future. Collecting The Contacts of people that Might buy computers based on their activity, and selling to them. 13


# The Internet is Broken

Ben Tarnoff offers a vision for the future internet with a different set of ground rules.[^web3] He envisions an internet where the public has a greater stake in the services offered. It's not without precedent. The internet was created with public money. The decision to hand the space over to private interests was met with facile debates in the United States Congress during the mid-1990s. But some forward-thinking congresspeople like Daniel Inouye were invested in the idea of an "public lane on the information superhighway[^29]

[^web3]:Most current proposals for the internet's next evolution, often called Web3, are stuck in Clinton-era logic. The aforementioned *Framework for Global Electronic Commerce* conveys a belief that civic governance stops the market's ability to realize the public's needs and wants. Today's well-capitalized Web3 initiatives are often funded by many of the same folks that lead the initial financialization of the web, such as Andreessen Horowitz. The people who lead the way to a broken internet are not the ones to fix it.

> [He] introduced a bill in 1994 that would have made telecom companies reserve up to 20 percent of their capacity for "public uses." This capacity would be considered "public property"---the telecoms would have no control over it. And it would be used to offer free access to qualifying organizations, such as libraries, nonprofits, and educational institutions, so long as they provided "educational, informational, cultural, civic, or charitable services directly to the public..."

This turning point in the internet's history is the linchpin of Tarnoff's argument. The author claims that the internet is broken because it is treated like a business; a more equitable, privacy-respecting internet will require provisions for substantive governance outside of commercial interests.[^is-a-business]

[^is-a-business]: "The root is simple: the internet is broken because the internet is a business." (Tarnoff 11)

But what exactly is broken? Consider internet access in the United States. The last place I lived in New York City offered me the choice of two providers. When I lived in Peoria, Illinois in the 1990s[^freenet] I had at least 4 times as many choices.[^deregulation]

[^freenet]: Further, there were also public options. I was quite fond of dialing into the [Heartland Freenet](http://textfiles.com/internet/cwis.txt), &ldquo;a community owned and operated not for profit bulletin board system [...] modeled after public television and public radio.&rdquo; It had a free internet connection at 136.176.5.114 by way of Bradley University, according to [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/04/nyregion/information-freeway-open-data-path-is-urged.html). The article published on August 4, 1994 notes that the service required &ldquo;$45,000 a year to keep its connection open for the 1,400 people a day who sign on.&rdquo;

[^deregulation]: "[In 1998] 92 percent of Americans had the choice of seven or more ISPs simply by using a modem over their phone line. But in the aftermath of a 2005 Supreme Court decision that affirmed the Bush-era deregulations, the big ISPs began refusing their competitors access to their infrastructure." (Tarnoff 35)

The *Framework for Global Electronic Commerce* promised that "expanded services" and "lower prices" would arise from "a market-driven arena, not in an environment that operates as a regulated industry." Well it didn't happen in New York City or anywhere else in the United States. Average internet costs are high and speeds are slow when compared to Europe and Asia. Further, folks in the United States are more dissatisfied with their internet service providers than the much maligned airline companies and the byzantine health insurers.[^36]

[^36]: (Tarnoff 36)

While the rest of the world doesn't need to worry about the United States' access problems, they are indicative of what's wrong further up the stack at the application layer. Applications built by Amazon, Facebook, and Google present immediate global concerns.

It will take years to understand the deepening ties between commerce and information systems. Early studies and anecdotal evidence suggest everything from a confidence crisis in teenage girls to threats to the foundations of democracy.

I am not prepared to blame social ills on a shifting media landscape. In Kenneth Goldsmith's love letter to the World Wide Web, *Wasting Time on the Internet*, he observes folks with a rich online social life, people deeply engaged with the written word, and children who love both video gaming and playing in the park.[^2022-study] Media theorists like Marshall McLuhan observed endless cycles of new media displacement; those who swim in old media reflexively deride the perceived effects of new media.

[^2022-study]: A [2022 study by Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/11/16/connection-creativity-and-drama-teen-life-on-social-media-in-2022/) demonstrates the more nuanced/positive effects of social media: &ldquo;Majorities of teens credit social media with strengthening their friendships and providing support while also noting the emotionally charged side of these platforms.&rdquo;

What remains explicitly clear is the fact that folks are not gathering in the digital equivalent of parks and town squares, they are gathering in online centers of commerce. Our digital public spaces, often called "platforms," are really purpose-built shopping malls. This distinction is where Tarnoff's book shines.

These so-called platforms are engineered to drive purchases. We have no right to contract when we enter. Their terms exchange our privacy and sovereignty for their service. Those who disagree will find it hard to have a private conversation elsewhere if the world's eMails (think Gmail), phone calls (think Skype), and texts (think WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger) run through their shopping mall. The explicit trade-off is our data and it's impossible for better terms to arise in this arrangement.[^chester]

[^chester]: This is the completely predictable outcome of Clinton's policies. Tarnoff cites activist Jeffrey Chester warning of "a virtual electronic shopping mall" overtaking the public internet as far back as 1993.

Tarnoff's book is succinct and clear-sighted. It's the rare book that offers a breezy read while also positing profound observations on contemporary digital life.
