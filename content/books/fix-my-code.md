*[Fix My Code](https://eeclectic.de/produkt/fix-my-code/)*

TODO: Get a NAG image

The book centers around the restoration of the Sollfrank's 1999 piece, the Net Art Generator (NAG). [ZKM purchased the server](https://zkm.de/en/artwork/net-art-generator) which runs the NAG and has taken responsibility for ensuring that NAG will run well into the future. A single NAG on aging hardware does not provide this guarantee, so the institution also took it upon themselves to ensure the code is runnable on other machines. The book spends fruitful time ruminating questions of authenticity and ownership as a consequence.

Sollfrank is a net.art artist who embraced the 1990s supposition that the internet was a new independent space. "For me, working with the internet had a lot to do with institutional critique." But it wasn't long before net.art was revealed as just another territory with borders drawn long the old lines of authorship and intellectual property. The more radical position is actually summed up nicely by the Net Art Generator's license:

> The nag is under the GPL and as free software it does not really correspond to traditional notions of property, especially the ones in the art world. The idea behind free software is that is belongs to the public, and everybody who has the skills to help maintain or improve it can and should do so.

NAG provides another way to approach the decades-old culture of Free and Open Source Software. Perhaps because it is art, NAG allows for a different terminology when addressing software's penchant for decay. Rather than talking about running a "software update" or "maintaining the codebase," Sollfrank introduces the notion of *care*.

> Caring means worrying, being ready to take responsibility, being on the lookout for new types of relations. This attitude of care also contributes to the establishment of new forms of knowledge, knowledge that is interested not only in observation and representation but also in transformation â€“ in forging relations with things, in being affected, and thus in changing itself and the world in a process of co-transformation. Joan C. Tronto and Berenice Fisher have defined caring as a way of maintaining, continuing, and repairing our world for a better life.

Quite frankly, it's a beautiful approach. Today ZKM is caring for the NAG. But software preservationists see a future where care is a distributed resource. Cultural objects on the internet are our inheritance. It is up to us to maintain them.[^archive-team]

[^archive-team]: This may be practically embodied by the [Archive Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_Team). This group has saved much of our digital heritage from certain oblivion.

These sentiments run afoul of traditional notions of intellectual property. *Fix My Code* is forced to address this head on because NAG uses Google's search API to gather its images. Google has not only changed how the API works over the years, they have also changed how many search can occur. Sollfrank details her attempt to get some sort of cultural exception. Google does have an [Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/) team, but they are mostly aligned with established institutions. Sollfrank found Google's awareness of contemporary net.art lacking and failed to secure any exception.

But net.art and computer art are not a fully legitimized mediums. The needle only moves after Christie's sells the AI-generated work, *[Portrait of Edmond Belamy](https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx)*, for half a million dollars. *Fix My Code* opines that the money legitimizes the art object and the medium itself. A sad state for cultural expression.

This is the Wild West of the art world. And artists themselves feel the stress of working in the unknown. The tools of production are complex and changing quickly. Sollfrank and Soon's collaboration is an "essential" byproduct of working in the digital realm. "You [the artist] never know enough, your skills are never sufficient." The internet is littered with the cries of exasperated programmers working alone asking arcane questions about code that just won't work. *Fix My Code* is a book that nods to this reality but takes a holistic, creative, and convivial path towards a better way of building systems and maintaining the cultural objects that help define who we are.
