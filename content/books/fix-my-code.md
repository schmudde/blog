TODO: Get a NAG image

Interest in interactive digital art paralleled the growing interest in networked computers throughout the 1990s. 1998 marked the first publication of a glossy magazine named ArtByte that was distributed across the United States. The magazine covered net- and computer-based art and culture. Rhizome, an organization established to help explore the internet as a creative medium, built the ArtBase a year later to help preserve net.art artworks. So by the time Cornelia Sollfrank's "Net Art Generator" (NAG) came online in 1999, net.art was a nascent medium beginning to come of age.

The next twenty years will see the NAG updated and modified in an effort to keep the artwork running. The original server is [eventually acquired](https://zkm.de/en/artwork/net-art-generator) by The ZKM Center for Art and Media, who has taken the responsibility of caring for the artifact and its code. A single NAG on aging hardware provides little guarantee of its longevity. ZKM must also make the code runnable on other machines.

Cornelia Sollfrank and programmer Winnie Soon confront issues of authenticity and ownership as they attempt to update the NAG's code. These issues are captured through a long-running conversation between the artist and the programmer in the new book *[Fix My Code](https://eeclectic.de/produkt/fix-my-code/)*. I love this book. It takes issues that normally seem removed from everyday life - intellectual property, the preservation of cultural objects, and the way social thinking influences computer languages - and turns them into practical problems the two women must solve as they attempt to get keep the NAG running well into the 21st century.

Sollfrank is a net.art artist who embraced the 1990s supposition that the internet was a new independent space. "For me, working with the internet had a lot to do with institutional critique." Someone publishing on the internet could potentially reach as many people as an established institution. The next Jackson Pollock didn't need the backing of a Peggy Guggenheim to get their work in front of other people. Suddenly anything seemed possible.

But it wasn't long before net.art was revealed as just another territory with borders drawn along the old lines of authorship and intellectual property. Institutions arrived. Speculative money was thrown around. Commercial traffic became paramount. When Christie's sells an AI-generated work, *[Portrait of Edmond Belamy](https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx)*, for half a million dollars, it may seem radical, but it's really just propping up a 20th century institution and a 20th century way of thinking. When artist-made NFTs became an internet sensation, it may seem like a radical departure, but it's perpetuating traditional forms of art ownership.

The NAG comes from a much different place that is perhaps best summed up by the artwork's license:

> The nag is under the GPL and as free software it does not really correspond to traditional notions of property, especially the ones in the art world. The idea behind free software is that is belongs to the public, and everybody who has the skills to help maintain or improve it can and should do so.

Christie's auctions and NFTs legitimize creative mediums simply because the financial value attached to them. A sad state for cultural expression.

Perplexed me:


> Thank you for visiting. As many of their readers are aware, ArtByte ceased publication at the end of 2001. As the digital culture overwhelmed, and has eventully become the mainstream, the digital world is now part of our everyday lives. Futhermore, the post 9/11 economy can no longer support a dedicated digital arts & culture publication.

## Care













The NAG provides another way to approach the decades-old culture of Free and Open Source Software. Perhaps because it is art, the NAG allows for a different terminology when addressing software's penchant for decay. Rather than talking about running a "software update" or "maintaining the codebase," Sollfrank introduces the notion of *care*.

> Caring means worrying, being ready to take responsibility, being on the lookout for new types of relations. This attitude of care also contributes to the establishment of new forms of knowledge, knowledge that is interested not only in observation and representation but also in transformation â€“ in forging relations with things, in being affected, and thus in changing itself and the world in a process of co-transformation. Joan C. Tronto and Berenice Fisher have defined caring as a way of maintaining, continuing, and repairing our world for a better life.

Quite frankly, it's a beautiful approach. Today ZKM is caring for the NAG. But software preservationists see a future where care is a distributed resource. Cultural objects on the internet are our inheritance. It is up to us to maintain them.[^archive-team]

[^archive-team]: This may be practically embodied by the [Archive Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_Team). This group has saved much of our digital heritage from certain oblivion.

These sentiments run afoul of traditional notions of intellectual property. *Fix My Code* is forced to address this head on because the NAG uses Google's search API to gather its images. Over the years Google has changed the API, which breaks other software that depends on their product. The company has also changed the rules of engagement. They have changed the number of searches that can be conducted through the API before requesting significant payment.

Sollfrank details her attempt to get some sort of cultural exception in "Fix My Code." Although Google has a dedicated [Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/) initiative, these teams generally work with established institutions rather than their peers in the net.art space. Sollfrank was unable to secure a cultural exception for net.art from the internet-born giant. She generally found Google's awareness of the movement lacking.

This is the Wild West of the art world. And artists themselves feel the stress of working in the unknown. The tools of production are complex and changing quickly. The NAG was originally written at a time when the programming language Perl was quite fashionable. Winnie Soon, the co-author of *Fix My Code* and the programmer conducting the NAG's restoration, has to come to terms with the language and its culture. The exploration of Perl offers a fresh perspective on what constitutes the essence of a computer languages; it is so much more than the syntax on the screen.

Sollfrank and Soon's collaboration is the essential byproduct of working in the digital realm. "You [the artist] never know enough, your skills are never sufficient." The internet is littered with the cries of exasperated programmers working alone asking arcane questions about code that just won't work. *Fix My Code* is a book that nods to this reality but takes a holistic, creative, and convivial path towards a better way of building systems and maintaining the cultural objects that help define who we are.

>  Sopht's hack is Denial of Service, or DoS, where a system is shut down (usually a corporate target) by moving more traffic to it than it can handle. DoS is the most spectacular and contested hack within the community and the world at large. For one thing, DoS generates a lot of publicity.

> Q: What are the forms electronic resistance takes today? A: In the mid-'90s, the group Critical Art Ensemble published a book called Electronic Civil Disobedience. The basic assumption of the book is that power and its representations are no longer located in the real world but have been shifted onto the Net. That's why the resistance against power has also got to take place within the Net. The model CAE developed transfers civil disobedience from real life to the virtual world. So that's what I do, a kind of electronic civil disobedience. What it's about is blocking the flow of information rather than the flow of personnel, and it takes place at military, corporate, or governmental sites.
