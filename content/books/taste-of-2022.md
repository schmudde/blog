A few highlights from 2022. As I wrote my journal in July 2022, "Paradise is a city filled with culture, a quiet snowy night, or the sounds of crickets in the cornfields." These sights and sounds reflect that sentiment.

I give preference for creative work done in the last year. But I'll also mention a few things that were new to me.

# Book

*[Internet For the People](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3927-internet-for-the-people)*[^internet-for-the-people]

Ben offers a vision for the future internet with a different set of ground rules. Tarnoff claims that the internet is broken because it is treated like a business; a more equitable, privacy-respecting internet will require provisions for substantive governance outside of commercial interests.

# Essay

"[All That Is Solid Melts Into Information](https://www.noemamag.com/all-that-is-solid-melts-into-information/)" in *Noema*

> Art has always brought forth a new reality, a new form of perception. All his life, Paul Klee said: “Immanently, I cannot be grasped at all. Because I live with the dead, just as I live with the unborn. A bit nearer to the heart of creation than is usual. And not near enough at all yet.”

-   We greet information with a fundamental suspicion: Things might be otherwise. Contingency is a trait of information, and for this reason fake news is a necessary element of the informational order.
-   The torrent of accelerated time without narrative is disorienting our society and fragmenting community, philosopher Byung-Chul Han tells @NoemaMag. Art can help put the pieces back together.

[Actors, Objects, and Linked Data](https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/actors-objects-and-linked-data-7f60701af9bd) on

> I agree that data is important. We need standards about our data, and paying attention to data is an important precondition to making identity better. However, I assert that identity is NOT all about data. It’s all about the identity subject. I’m not just throwing that out as a slogan or an opinion; the very definition of identity requires it to be all about a subject. And when that subject is human, then the identity is all about an actor. How big is that word in our tag cloud?

> I think the reason we talk about data so much is because data is what the information economy can process to extract value. And processing to extract value is something that we do to objects, not actors. That worries me. It really worries me.

# Cinema and Streaming

*Boiling Point* (cinema, UK) and *Love and Anarchy* (Netflix, Norway) to the list of contemporary favorites.

The German film [Rabiye Kurnaz Vs. George W. Bush](<https://deadline.com/2022/02/review-rabiye-kurnaz-vs-george-w-bush-berlin-film-festival-1234932367/>) by Andreas Dresen was the most adept portrayal of a significant real world event I've seen since *The Big Short*. The playful cultural stereotypes (“Germans are smart but slow…” “Do you know the saying ‘start it like a Turk but finish it like a German’?”) were incredibly popular with the audience at the Freiluftkino Friedrichsain in Berlin.

The Italian film

# Travel

![Grand Teton National Park](/img/taste-of-2022/grand-teton-1.jpg)

The Grand Teton mountains jet out of the flat Wyoming terrain to pierce the state's big skies. The winter bring a lunar landscape and crossing the mountains in the dead of night to reach Idaho was a driving experience.

The rest of that trip in the United States included places like Provo, UT, Yellowstone, Missoula, MT, and Seattle WA. Other visits in the USA included New York City, Chicago, St. Louis, and my hometown of Peoria, IL.

I occasionally left my home in Turin, Italy to ramble around the country - Bardonecchia, Udine, Lake Como, Elba Island, Siena, Florence, Gran Paradiso, Bertinoro, Santa Margherita, Parragi (July), - and parts of Europe: Lisbon, PR, Lille, FR, Crete, GR, and my spiritual home on this continent, Berlin, DR.

# Exhibition

The Tresor 31 exhibition ended up being the highlight. Honestly, few exhibitions stood out. Berlin Art in Berlin, All America in Peoria, IL.

Permanent exhibition at Prada. A couple exhibitions at Camera and Mao. Finally got to the re-opening of the Neue Gallerie in Berlin, having not been there since 2002. And finally saw the Tarkovsky installation.

# Concert

My year was filled with Einstürzende Neubauten. I saw the group's bassist, Alexander Hacke, perform with his wife at the beginning of the year. Then I saw the entire group in at the Teatro Colosseo in Turin. It was the first time since seeing them at The Fillmore in San Francisco on 22/July/2000. I also happened to have pre-Covid tickets for a performance in Berlin where they put n their best show for the hometown crowd.

But I was equally joyful to see the Italian group NOKTVA last month at Ziggy in Turin. Small venue, great fans, and a passionate band playing awesome music.

# Meditation

24-January-2022 Turin, Italy.

I had the most love-focused meditation tonight. It was lead by Pina on Rudi's birthday. She did not offer words until the end, but The outpouring of my heart was profound. Bellissimo!
