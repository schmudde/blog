# Books

*[The Shapeless Unease](shapeless-unease.html)*[^cover] by Samantha Harvey (2020) was my most profound read of 2023. It is a novel of disorienting time dilation where days and nights coalesce into a maddening blur. A full review is [here](shapeless-unease.html).

# Cinema and Streaming

The two best films I saw in 2023 were *Le otto montagne* (*The Eight Mountains* (2022)) and *[Aftersun](https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/aftersun-ending-explained-exploring-the-meaning-behind-it-and-what-happened-to-calum)*.

*Le otto montagne* featured a rare depiction of a friendship between
two adult men.[^8-mountains] It is sensitive to both the joy and the suffering that a deep bond brings. It's also shot in 4:3 aspect ratio, a particularly unusual choice in films where
the grandeur of the mountains plays a significant role.

[^8-mountains]: *The Eight Mountains* is currently availabe [to stream on Criterion Collection](https://www.criterion.com/films/33541-the-eight-mountains) in the United States.

# Music

## Concerts

Nuovo Testament blew me away at St.Vitus in New York City. I discovered them months before when I picked up their first album, *Exposure* (2019), at [Static Shock Records](https://www.staticshockmusik.com/) in Berlin. Coincidentally, my close friend Ryan Project bought us tickets to see them when I visited. Although their first album is more my speed,the performance of their current work at Saint Vitus was on of the best concerts in recent memory.

But I was recently reminded of a Soft Moon concert here in Turin that I saw with [Ignacio](https://blog.ignaciobrasca.com/). I've seen Soft Moon several times but this ale was special. So special, in fact that the band , just released a concert video of the show. Turns out main man Luis Vasquez burst ear drum that night. I vividly remember his carnal performance so I can't say I'm surprised.[^news]

[^news]: Terrible news - [The Soft Moon, Luis Vasquez, Has Died](https://thequietus.com/articles/33763-the-soft-moon-luis-vasquez-has-died) along with [Silent Servant](https://thequietus.com/articles/33761-silent-servant-has-died). I have seen The Soft Moon maybe five times and Luis always put everything into his performance. Silent Servant was also a gift to see behind the decks. I will miss both greatly.

# Travels

![La Valle Stretta](/img/taste-of-2023/la-valle-stretta.jpg)

One of the most beautiful hikes I've taken in my life was just a hundred kilometers west of my place in Turin - La Valle Stretta. I actually had plenty of Alpine time between Bardonecchia, Champex, Meana, and Sauze dʼOulx. Then there were also Bonneval-sur-Arc and Briançon just a bit further into France. Speaking of, I also spent time in Lille and Paris.

I spent a very special day in Ivrea, Italy [visiting the old Olivetti campus](https://mastodon.social/@schmudde/110207958419761475). And also made stops in Friuli, Milan, and Sardegna.

When I ventured further, I also made it Frankfurt, Berlin (x 2!), and Lisbon. And back in the United States I spent time in New York City, Chicago, Peoria, and St. Louis.

# Podcasts

My first Buddhist practice with a Sangha (community) was in the Vajrayana lineage. I eventually left for a less mystical tradition. But there is much to be learned from the Vajrayana practices and Ken McLeod presents them in a deeply rational way without dismissing the "Magical" elements of the tradition. He was so compelling that I have started reading his books. They will certainly find a place on my 2024 list. [The Magic of Vajrayana ](https://deconstructingyourself.com/the-magic-of-vajrayana-with-ken-mcleod.html), [The Magic of Vajrayana Part 2](https://deconstructingyourself.com/the-magic-of-vajrayana-part-2-with-ken-mcleod.html)

# Essays

Robin Sloan's *[Specifying Spring ’83](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/)* (November 2022) ruminates on what's possible on the web. Simple protocols that seek to liberate us from the hegemony of the social media timeline. His followup a month later, *[A Year of New Avenues](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/)* is also worth a read.

*[The Miracle of the Commons](https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth)* (May 2021)  is an important essay in the struggle to bust myths about how the Commons functions both historically and in the present day.[^commons]

[^commons]: The essay challenges the widely accepted idea that communal resources are inevitably doomed to overuse and destruction, arguing instead that we humans have a capacity for collaboratively managing and preserving shared resources. It does't simply argue the historical context, the author cites contemporary community-managed systems around the world.

# Meditation

From 30-March-2023 in Udine, Italy, I wrote:

> Meditation by moonlight. This is an experience that is too rare in bigger cities.
