This book was an odd journey. I didn’t immediately respond to Kenko’s writing. Many of the entries seem like the musings of a cantankerous, judgmental, and isolated man. It’s not that I disliked him. I simply didn’t find him engaging.

But the further I read, the more gems the book offered. Certain aphorisms are especially succinct and beautiful.

> No one owns a splendid view, so nothing prevents the heart’s delight in it. (542-543)

Certain aphorisms hit close to home.

> A careful fool is on the road to success; one who is skilful but headstrong is headed for failure. (2136-2137)

I began to enjoy Kenko’s observations. I even adopted his style in my own practice of journaling. Our reasons for writing seem to run parallel:

> Things thought but left unsaid only fester inside you. So I let my brush run on like this for my own foolish solace. (761-763)

Although it’s a very old manuscript, it feels very familiar. This is partially because of the timeless nature of Buddhist wisdom. But even cultural observations felt contemporary.

> We would be no worse off if we lacked all things Chinese, aside from medicine. Chinese books are widely found in our country now, and are perfectly easy to make copies of. It is quite ridiculous the way such a throng of ships makes the difficult crossing from China, all crammed to the gunwales with useless objects. (1584-1588)

Speaking of Chinese exports, I enjoy the  game of Go immensely. Kenko makes several references to the ancient game, such as this gem:

> [A holy man once declared] those who devote themselves day in day out to playing go or sugoroku are committing a sin more heinous than the Four Transgressions or the Five Wickednesses.”(1524-1527, entry 111)

A lived life is full of transgressions. Kenko whimsically captures how we can impulsively hurt others as we hurt ourselves.

> [He] heard the bubbling of a pot of beans being boiled over a fire made from their husks. ‘We’re so closely related and yet you boil us so brutally!’ they were crying, and the bean husks crackling in the flames seemed to him to reply, ‘Do you imagine we’re boiling you on purpose? It’s excruciating for us to be burning like this, heaven knows, but we’re powerless to stop. (1202-1205)

Kenko enjoys making amusing observations about religious orthodoxy. He recounts a story where a man commands his horse to lift its leg as it is being bathed. A saint passes by and mishears the command ‘Ashis! Ashi!’ (literally ‘Leg! Leg!’) as ‘Aji! Aji!’, the name of the first vowel in Sanskrit and a religious symbol of the origin of all things. The saint figures that the man has found enlightenment when in reality he is just giving instructions to his horse.

His critiques of the orthodoxy can be sharply worded:

> There are endless examples of something that attaches itself to another, eats away at it and harms it. A body has fleas. A house has rats. A nation has robbers. A lesser man has wealth. An honourable man has moral imperatives. A monk has the Buddhist Law. (1404-1406)

While also espousing the urgency and necessary of religious practice:

> The truly momentous events of life – the changes from birth through life, transformation and death – are like the powerful current of a raging river. They surge ever forward without a moment’s pause. Thus, when it comes to the essentials, both in religious and in worldly life, you should not wait for the right moment in what you wish to achieve, nor dawdle over preparations. (1902-1908)

The essence of Buddhism is not something that can be captured in law nor in books. It is something that can only be experienced.

> Let me now say a few words, however, to those who dedicate themselves to the search for knowledge and the desire for understanding. Knowledge leads to deception; talent and ability only serve to increase earthly desires. Knowledge acquired by listening to others or through study is not true knowledge. So what then should we call knowledge? Right and wrong are simply part of a single continuum. What should we call good? One who is truly wise has no knowledge or virtue, nor honour nor fame. Who then will know of him, and speak of him to others? This is not because he hides his virtue and pretends foolishness – he is beyond all distinctions such as wise and foolish, gain and loss. (927-932)

And how do we experience Buddhism? By becoming buddhas.

> The year I turned eight, I asked my father, ‘What sort of thing is a buddha?’ ‘A buddha is what a human becomes,’468 he replied. (2622-2623)
