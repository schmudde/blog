<div class="epigraph">
> In art-making one sees oneself as a river but also as the boat on the river, periodically tossed on to the shore only to be caught up in the river's momentum once again. When this vision is achieved, creative individuals are able to move with excitement from one project to the next, from one idea to the next, completing one and beginning another, in an endless tide of creation, cessation, and creation again. If you are lucky, you can surround yourself with others tossed about by the same, tumultuous waters. And if you are very lucky, while on your own journey, they will invite you to enter into and comment on theirs.

The other night I was talking to a friend about sharing political opinions on Twitter. As I watch from Italy, the United States is suffering a crisis of conscious as it attempts to navigate a pandemic. Looming in the background is a presidential election in November where disinformation is being spread about the basic mechanisms of democracy - most recently regarding [the legitimacy of mail-in ballots](https://roguerocket.com/2020/05/27/twitter-fact-checks-trump/) - from the very head of the government itself.

**I still believe that the best internet is the internet that engenders community and conversation**. The network of thought is like a community of artists. **Each person who shares their small creative act invites a response**. An observed reaction cannot be unseen. The river only flows one way.

The bureaucrat is a slave to the machine. They move information along uncritically. No conversation is desired or necessary; the acts are justified by the process itself.

**The performative aspects of social media** - likes, retweets, and chasing &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; - **are different than the conversational tools of message boards and newsgroups**. The former obscures the difference between conflict and conversation. Engagement numbes are cosmetic. They say nothing about meaningful dialogue.

So my line is simple - I share political opinions online when I feel like I have something to contribute to a conversation. And that's not very often.

[^licklider-photo]: {-} J.C.R. Licklider (1915-1990). Photographer Ben Shneiderman remembers, &ldquo;I enjoyed his visit to our group at the University of Maryland in April 1979, when I took this photo, and soon after appreciated his kindness as my host to speak at MIT.&rdquo; (Ben Shneiderman, [*J.C.R. Licklider*](https://computerhistory.org/blog/computer-pioneers-photos-from-the-field/?key=computer-pioneers-photos-from-the-field), image, 1979.)

**Why isn't the internet better at engendering conversations?** J.C.R. Licklider, a significant force in establishing our internet, wanted to &ldquo;interconnect the separate communities and thereby transform them into a supercommunity.&rdquo;[^licklider] Licklider foresaw the importance of community and communications in the ambitiously named &ldquo;Intergalactic Computer Network&rdquo;:

> What will on-line interactive communities be like? In most fields they will consist of geographically separated members, sometimes grouped in small clusters and sometimes working individually. They will be communities not of common location, but of common interest.

[^licklider]: J.C.R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor, "The Computer As A Communication Device", *Science And Technology*, April 1968.

Licklider argued that people would be happier if they participated in communities of shared interest rather than &ldquo;accidents of proximity.&rdquo;[^licklider-2] I have found this to be true - as a teenager dialing into BBSes in mid-1990s Peoria, IL and as an adult living in Turin, Italy during the COVID pandemic.

[^licklider-2]: Licklider's vision for a &ldquo;network of networks&rdquo; was profound its scope and relatively unique in its time. Beyond communities of interest, he shares three other outcomes of a networked society: &ldquo;Second, communication will be more effective and productive, and therefore more enjoyable. Third, much communication and interaction will be with programs and programmed models [...]. And, fourth, there will be plenty of opportunity for everyone to find his calling, for the whole world of information, with all its fields and disciplines, will be open to him.&rdquo; (J.C.R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor, "The Computer As A Communication Device", *Science And Technology*, April 1968.)

At his best, Licklider was an imaginative manager who empowered creative individuals across computing. His work had a tremendous impact on the internet, graphical user interfaces, and computer science education. The artists.

At his worst, Licklider was a technocrat. He effectively navigated the military bureaucracies of the Cold War by promising predictive models using complex data to bolster counterinsurgency efforts at home and around the world.[^levine] The bureaucrats.

[^levine]: See Yasha Levine on Licklider and Ithiel de Sola Pool's 1969 ARPA Cambridge Project: &ldquo;Once complete, it would allow any intelligence analyst or military planner connected to the ARPANET to upload dossiers, financial transactions, opinion surveys, welfare rolls, criminal record histories, and any other kind of data and to analyze them in all sorts of sophisticated ways: sifting through reams of information to generate predictive models, mapping out social relationships, and running simulations that could predict human behavior.&rdquo; (Yasha Levine, *Surveillance Valley: The Rise Of The Military-Digital Complex* (PublicAffairs, 2018))

&ldquo;I think more people outta get in there and think about the social process,&rdquo; suggests Licklider in the video below; he raises his concern for techonology moving faster than society's abililty to adapt. But who should be thinking about this? How will we fund this thinking? Perhaps most consequentally, none of his poetic musings on community ever mentions how these communities will be managed. Managing local communities has long been uncompenstated labor.

Small communities are the most valuable part of the internet. They are where real conversation happens. Supercommunities.


Indeed - we should be thinking about - and funding - people who are thinking about the role of computer networks in society. --- bureaucracies/artists

## &ldquo;The Computer As A Communication Device&rdquo;

&ldquo;First, life will be happier for the on-line individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity. Second, communication will be more effective and productive, and therefore more enjoyable. Third, much communication and interaction will be with programs and programmed models [...]. And, fourth, there will be plenty of opportunity for everyone to find his calling, for the whole world of information, with all its fields and disciplines, will be open to him.&rdquo;
