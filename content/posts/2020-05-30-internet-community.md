<div class="epigraph">
> In art-making one sees oneself as a river but also as the boat on the river, periodically tossed on to the shore only to be caught up in the river's momentum once again. When this vision is achieved, creative individuals are able to move with excitement from one project to the next, from one idea to the next, completing one and beginning another, in an endless tide of creation, cessation, and creation again. If you are lucky, you can surround yourself with others tossed about by the same, tumultuous waters. And if you are very lucky, while on your own journey, they will invite you to enter into and comment on theirs.

I got into a discussion night about sharing political opinions on Twitter. I am watching from Italy as major cities in my country are experiencing violent clashes between the police and protesters as the nation attempts to rebuild from a pandemic. Looming in the background is a presidential election in November where disinformation is being spread about the basic mechanisms of democracy - most recently regarding [the legitimacy of mail-in ballots](https://roguerocket.com/2020/05/27/twitter-fact-checks-trump/) - from the very head of the government itself.

Most of what I share on Twitter is not political. I still hold onto the belief that the best internet is the internet that engenders community and conversation. If we are in a space where we are all creating and sharing information, our process is more like that of an artist than a bureaucrat. Artists who share their work inherently invites critical response. The response invariably influences the next work. Artists may not like the criticism. They may bristle or disagree. But the reception of critical response cannot be undone. The river only flows one way.

The bureaucrat is a slave to the machine. They uncritically move information along. No criticism or conversation will change their behavior because they are justified by the larger machine. There is no tide, there is only process.

I share political opinions when I feel like I have something to contribute to a *conversation*. Conversations require trust and a sense of community. Corporate social media platforms sometimes succeed at cultivating these conditions, but rarely around politicized issues.

This is the fundamental misstep from the earliest conceptions of cyberspace. When J.C.R. Licklider wrote about the digital communities of the future as the helped build the ARPANET, he focused on people gathering because of a shared passion. The Intergalactic --- (later called the internet), he believed, would bring people together based on ideas and not arbitrary geographic restrictions. By bringing the best minds together, the best ideas would surface and productivity would boom. But Licklider was a bit of a technocrat. He underestimated the kind of hard work that goes into building healthy communities. Over 60 years later, Silicon Valley continues to make the same mistake.
