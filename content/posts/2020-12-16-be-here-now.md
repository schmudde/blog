A reflection on Ram Dass' 1971 classic, *Be Here Now* and it's connection to information and our state of being.

# The Person

Like many who walk the hallways of elite institutions, Ram Dass' life intersected with influential mid-century thinkers and doers. His most famous collaborator might have been Timothy Leary in the early 1960s. Their landmark studies of psychedelic drugs lead to his dismissal from Harvard in 1963.

Ram Dass' association with David Padwa is of more immediate interest to me. Padwa established a company called Basic Systems was a millionaire by the time he met the young author in the late 1960s.[^padwa] Basic Systems automated employee training and student education, often integrating into an institution's existing computer infrastructure. The company caught the eye of Xerox Corporation and was soon acquired. It fit nicely with Xerox's growing digital portfolio. As the copier company sought to establish the office of the future, it would soon acquire the influential minicomputer manufacturer [Scientific Data Systems](https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/340) and establish the legendary [Xerox PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)).

[^padwa]: From David Padwa's [Curriculum Vitae](http://www.cuke.com/people/padwa.htm): &ldquo;1960-1965. Founder and CEO of Basic Systems Inc. Principal offices in Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Pasadena, and Washington, DC. Firm specialized in educational and curricular technologies as well as the provision of systems integration services in education and training markets. In 1964 Xerox Corporation acquired Basic Systems; continued as division executive at Xerox and Director of Planning for educational markets.&rdquo;

Padwa founded Basic Systems with the influential psychologist Francis Mechner. I was first exposed to Francis Mechner as a child playing *Karateka* on my Atari 7800 and then later *Prince of Persia* (1989) on my family's DTK IBM compatible PC. Francis Mechner was the composer for these games, written by his son [Jordan Mechner](http://jordanmechner.com/). The elder Mechner is something of a renaissance man: starting several successful businesses, speaking five languages, publishing cross-disciplinary theoretical insights, performing as a concert pianist, and achieving a 5-dan rating in Go.[^chess]

[^chess]: Padwa and Mechner's company also published the [original edition](https://books.google.it/books?id=TnVYAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y) of &ldquo;Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess&rdquo; in 1966. The best-selling book is still in print today.

These characters provide a sampling of the environment that nurtured Ram Dass. He would soon leave these comforts to join Padwa and his Land Rover on a road trip from Tehran to India in search of a spiritual awakening. Ram Dass ultimately stayed in India for some time (as did Padwa's Land Rover), leading to the insights that birthed the book *Be Here Now* (1971). This book's influence is without question. It was a significant contributor to the American counterculture movement and a starting point for many Western practitioners of Buddhism and Yoga.

# The Book

Ram Dass spends the first part of the book describing his journey. It involves a dive into the world of psychedelic trips and their purported benefits and limitations. His experience essentially opens him up to Eastern mysticism. He finds surprisingly few charlatans on the road through Central Asia and India. His eventual guru opens up his mind through a process of "no teaching" because "his lessons aroused in me just affirmation... as if I knew it all already."

The book strikes an important difference between *teacher* and *guru*. The author states that "a teacher points the way" while "a guru is the way." Ram Dass handed himself over to the guru. His awakening, and this book, is the result.

This leads to a beautifully illustrated but overtly dogmatic section where Ram Dass attempts wake the reader up. The writer's intention is rooted in Buddhism's long practice of shifting the practioner's habitual and unquestioned perception of the world.[^perception] Ram Dass' spiritual youth feels most pronounced here. He doesn't have the language of a guru or a teacher; it is the voice of an enthusastic lecturuer who is convinced that he has uncovered the truth.

[^perception]: Ram Dass' guru offers a few clever turns of phrases in this effort, "If a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets" and "If you wear shoeleather, the whole earth is covered with leather".

The final section of the book is a collection of quotes and techniques divided into various "ingredients for a sacred life" such as *Sleeping*, *Truth*, *Time and Space*, *Pranayam*, etc.... It is pleasant reading.

Ram Dass makes it clear that there can be no *knower* if one truly wants to *know*. The rational mind that separates *subject* from *object* is a work of fiction. This model can only consider external sources of information derived from the five senses which is associated with internal caches of memory. It offers little insight into leaps of intuition, the reality of paradox, or metaphysical sensations (Location 4594-4596, 4613-4615).

Buddhists understand that consciousness is more than the sum of the neurons in our brain. Everyday reality is the creation of countless sentient beings acting up information in the world around them. The present state of the world is the byproduct of historic forces that are older and larger and smaller than the scope of human imagination. Informatics and computer science have started to uncover and harness information's pervasive presence. It is an interconnected space which seems to manifest in paradox its edges, much like the fundamentals of mathematics that underpin our limited understanding.

Deep in the code of Atari 7800's Karateka, the programmer added the lines... Mommy and Me Are One. This bizarre, impossible statement

The reality of a consciousness larger than ourselves is at the root of *Be Here Now.* But rather than establish a God or a single methodology, Ram Dass continually attacks the ego. He quotes the Buddha as saying, "As long as you think there is a 'do-er' you are still caught in the wheel of birth and death." This is a call for the reader to practice presence in the act of doing - not projecting what the present means about the past or future, not projecting how the action may be perceived by other people, not trying to calculate the worth of an action.[^roshi]

[^roshi]: “A Zen student must learn to waste time conscientiously.” ~ Suzuki Roshi (Loc. 4728)

> As long as you are in your body you must do things. [...] Do what you do, but you do not identify with the doing of it.

(Loc. 4105)

Simply be here now.

Purification Exercise with Guru Rimpoche Consider a being of pure light and love (whom you can name Padmasambhava, the Lotus-evolved One, if you would like), who is sitting in the midst of a lake on a lotus flower in front of you. He is seen as being in front of you and slightly above you... so that you look up to him at about a thirty degree angle.
