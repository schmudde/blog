[^church]: {-} Suzanne Ciani in quadraphonic sound at Ambient Church 03-08-2018
</figure>

A favorite blog of mine, *On An Overgrown Path* by Bob Shingleton, published an article entitled "[Classical music must break through the electronic glass ceiling](https://www.overgrownpath.com/2020/03/classical-music-must-break-through.html)" where he cites [Ambient Church](https://ambient.church/) as a success story. He specifically highlights the [Suzanne Ciani](https://www.sevwave.com/bio) show I attended with good friend [ryan_project](https://twitter.com/ryan_project): *August 03, 2018: Suzanne Ciani in Quadraphonic Sound, Sarah Davachi*.[^quadraphonic] The projection mapping onto the church's structural features was particularly striking (seen above).

[^quadraphonic]: Ciani performed in support of her album [*LIVE Quadraphonic*](http://www.cykik.com/quad/ciani). It was distributed with a small device that decoded the record's quadraphonic image. The release marks Ciani's first solo Buchla performance in 40 years; it was performed using a Buchla 200e. The next year I happened to bump into an engineer who worked on the decoder at a Brooklyn bar named *Mood Ring*. It's a small world. ![LIVE Quadraphonic album cover](/img/2020-04-26-ambient-church/live-quadraphonic.jpg)

In many ways, Ambient Church mirrors the traditions of Classical Music. Founder [Brian Sweeny](https://briansweeny.zone) shows a metaphysical interest in mind/body connection. The music he programs is reverent in its own way.[^serious] It even (mostly) takes place in a church.

[^serious]: "Serious music" has a long history in Western music. Seneca's quote *res severa est verum gaudium* (true pleasure is a serious matter) was engraved above the stage at Leipzig's [Gewandhaus Concert Hall](https://www.gewandhausorchester.de/). The hall opened thirty years after the death of the city's most famous citizen, the very serious Johann Sebastian Bach. ![Altes Gewandhaus - Erster Konzertsaal von 1781-1885](/img/2020-04-26-ambient-church/csm_1881-Altes-Gewandhaus-Konzertsaal_73876a6594.jpg) via [Gewandhaus Concert Hall](https://www.gewandhausorchester.de/en/gewandhaus/history/)

Shingleton often wonders why classical music resists electronic elements like amplification and the use of synthesizers. From the entry:

> Why does classical music have such entrenched antagonism towards electronic sounds when one of its most successful recent compositions is closer to ambient electronica than a Beethoven symphony?

I believe that the answer lies in notation. Musical notation falls short of capturing the composer's intent, the performer's performance, and the audience's experience. However, it is the reason we have access to the music of Bach and Beethoven. Scores are information that has traveled through the centuries, slowly and subtly mutating along the way.

[^symbiosis]: Malcolm Pointon score for *Symbiosis* (1975) via "[Early British electronic music by Malcolm Pointon to be released for the first time](https://www.thewire.co.uk/news/44044/early-british-electronic-music-by-malcolm-pointon-to-be-released-for-the-first-time)" in *Wire*. More interesting scores are can be found on [this thread](https://llllllll.co/t/experimental-music-notation-resources/149) at llllllll.co.

Notation provides formality for formal music - music where virtuosity is displayed by the most minute details.

No standard for notating electro-acoustic instruments exist. Performances that include tape, acoustic effects like reverb, and synthesizers are extremely difficult to notate. The violin has been standardized over hundreds of years. There is no equivalent for settings across the myriad of 20th century musical inventions.

Compare Pointon's attempt to generalize changes in an electronic sound over time (above) to music written in Bach's own hand (below). The music from 1975 more recent, but the notes written in 1723 look and sound much more familiar.
