The blog is functional but it certainly is unattractive. Particularly, the text hierarchy is difficult to read. Time to add a little style.

Before getting started, I'm going to improve our workflow. It's worth the time invested. You won't want to go back to traditional methods once you experience interactive programming from Clojure's REPL.

## Interactive Programming

[LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) essentially hits the refresh for you.

[boot-livereload](https://github.com/Deraen/boot-livereload): live-reload of browser JS, HTML, CSS and images.

Add another tool to the development toolchain. Open the `build-boot` and add a new package to `:dependencies` called [boot-livereload](https://github.com/Deraen/boot-livereload).

- Here is the code for the latest version: `[deraen/boot-livereload "0.2.1"]`.
- Add this to `build.boot`'s `require` function: `'[deraen.boot-livereload :refer [livereload]]`

Now save the JavaScript that [LiveReload requires](http://livereload.com/browser/script-tag/) to a file called `livereload.js` under `resources/js/livereload.js`:

```
document.write('<script src="http://' + (location.host || 'localhost').split(':')[0] + ':35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></' + 'script>')
```
Perun offers an elegant way to inject the script into every page in the development environment. Under `(deftask dev []...` add `(perun/inject-scripts :scripts #{"js/livereload.js"})` followed by `(livereload :asset-path "public" :filter #"\.(css|html|js)$")`.
