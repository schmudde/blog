I stood on the roof deck of my ten-story hotel, uneasy, watching the Hilton Hotel tower in Kathmandu, Nepal consumed by fire just six kilometers away. I had never seen a blaze so immense - every floor was engulfed in flames.

In fact, the entire city was burning. There were blazes in every direction.[^tire-fire] Some fires only a kilometer away.

The inciting incident is well documented by now: on September 4, 2025 the government started to restrict access to over two dozen social media platforms. A movement known as "Gen Z" staged a protest on September 8th. The massive demonstration confronted the police outside the parliament and the police responded with lethal force. 19 died and the demonstrators responded with a fury the following day.

## The Politics of Social Media

The social media directive that justified the ban was hardly radical on its surface. Originally published on November 27, 2023, the [Social Media Management Directive 2080](https://pradhanlaw.com/publications/social-media-management-directive-2080-2023-ad) required platforms to register with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT), maintain a local point of contact, and comply with basic standards - removing hate speech, child exploitation, and other clearly objectionable content. The directive gave a deadline of February 22, 2024 and the Ministry itself had the power to ban non-compliant platforms.

Any small Asian country would be foolish not to take note of what happened in nearby Myanmar. A well-documented anti-Rohingya echo chamber on Facebook spiraled out of control by 2017 and eventually helped facilitate an organized effort to eradicate the ethnic group.

Facebook didn't have a representative working in Myanmar in 2017. And by 2024 no local representative existed in Nepal either. The general response to Directive 2080 from USA tech firms was a yawn. So the Supreme Court created their own order on August 17, 2025 for Social Media sites to comply. The administration of Prime Minister Oli jumped on this pretense and gave social media platforms 7 days to register starting on August 25th.

Nepali politics are complex like all politics. I deliberately used the word *pretense* because I'm suspicious of Oli's motives. But let's take a step back and look at what any democracy the size of Nepal is up against when they take on a company like Meta.

US internet companies have tried hard to stay out of politics. Their greatest shield is Section 230 in the United States. Meta claims that they're still running websites where people post things and they can't be held accountable for everything that happens there. With the introduction of the algorithmic newsfeed, this claim became false on its face. Algorithms are no more neutral than the people who write them; the impact of Facebook and Instagram editorial decisions are far more impactful than what happens at the New York Times. At one point there was even a political movement in the United States to try and do something about this - as well as the "Chinese Communist influence" of ByteDance's TikTok. But that has long disappeared as tech moguls have openly displayed their allegiance to the preeminent political movement in the United States - Conservatism.

Up to this point, global technology corporations have been able to foist their largely Libertarian and increasingly openly Conservative (generally known as the [The Californian Ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Californian_Ideology)) values onto hapless local populations. Like the energy and mineral conglomerates that preceded them, it's easy to ignore local laws. But these technology companies - like all telecommunications - are conduits for culture. So the byproduct of their local ignorance is different.

It wasn't always this way. At its revenue peak in 1985, IBM employed [they employed 405,000 people worldwide](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/how-big-was-ibm) - local staff whose very presence gave governments some leverage. Compare that to Facebook's paltry 70,000 employees. [TODO CITE] Their business model requires little on-the-ground knowledge: advertisements are mostly-self administered and the placement relies on automated bidding. IBM, on the other hand, had a tremendous global sales force that relied on local knowledge to be effective.

I admit that measuring outcomes casts a dark shadow on the benefits of local knowledge. Some of IBM's most profitable clients were Nazi Germany and Apartheid-era South Africa. My claim here is that local representation gives democracies a chance to manage their own media ecosystems. The alternative is to ignorantly project the cultural values of Silicon Valley onto the world. The autocrats will be fine either way - it's only democracy that suffers.

K. P. Sharma Oli was the fairly elected leader of Nepal. As a popular Marxist–Leninist, he has no equivalent figure in the United States. The political Left has no representation within US' two major parties. The Leftist ideology does not even have a public figure to act as a counterbalance the Conservative/Neoliberal duopoly within media. What brought about the collapse of the Nepalese government was the knowledge of rampant corruption. The entire political spectrum was guilty. Oli's attempt to assert some local control over Nepalese telecommunications was only the flash point. As a political project within a functioning democracy, it's unwise to challenge the overwhelming power of corporate United States. But the entire democratically-elected Leftist effort in Nepal was up against the Californian machine. Perhaps that's why Oli made this gamble why a more US-aligned politician would not.

To put it another way, if US Senator Josh Hawley can say this about Chinese-owned TikTok, why wouldn't a Communist politician on the other side of the ledger believe the same thing?

Meta hasn't built a 'dumb pipe' where information flows. It's time to stop treating them this way. Their choices have real-world implications in nearly every nation on earth, including the United States. Representation within the countries they control the majority of daily communication is the absolute most benign requirement. Such an arrangement might be good for business in some countries and bad in others. It may even lead to a Google/China moment. But long-term Meta begins to look more like IBM - a company who has made deep relationships with governments and businesses throughout the world.


## Mahākāla in the Clouds

The sense of normalcy in Kathmandu is striking in the days after the protests. This smoldering sites are isolated. So isolated, in fact, that a small cafe sits untouched while the CG Motors (<https://cgcorpglobal.com/companies/cg-motors>) car dealership to the west and the Kantipur publishing house immediately to the east are torched.

Site after site, the same story is told.[^nissan] A furious, angry mob descended on a target. Their rage is self-evident. But I don’t see much evidence of the random looting and destruction that is common after crowds become violent in the United States.

The scenes in Kathmandu remind me of Mahākāla, the fierce deity seen in the popular forms of Buddhism practiced in Nepal. Mahākāla is depicted as a frightening figure often surrounded by flames. But he is not evil. He embodies the nature of powerful emotions: unfocused, they consume everything; directed, they become empowering.

Kathmandu now has dozens of sites with that directed anger. Hotels, automobile dealerships, the Supreme Court, Parliament, the national Bar Association, and even sites of telecommunications and media. They reflect an abstract web of power when taken altogether. And manifest as corruption, nepotism, and an incredible wealth gap.

Kantipur Publishing, the largest publisher in Nepal, is seen as a political project manipulated by power players. In other words, the people of Nepal do not feel like they’re being told the truth.

8 kilometers away, another group of protesters attacked the manufacturing grounds and data centers of CG Electronics outside of Kathmandu-proper. They brought down the data centers owned by Nepal’s only billionaire. The ramifications were large enough that the Internet Society noted disruptions to the Internet throughout the country.

The tie between power and telecommunications should be self-evident. It is a topic that is under discussed in the United States and in Europe. But in Nepal, it is obvious; telecommunications made the fortune of the country’s only billionaire.

And then there are they posted checks and balances of the justice system. The protesters destroyed the Supreme Court and while doing so destroyed the digital records kept therein. What is the use of court documents in a country where the corruption continues year after year, decade after decade?

It is telling that the pragmatic organizers behind the protests eventually accepted the former chief justice of the Supreme Court, TODO, to lead the country as the interim Prime Minister. She had a record of trying corruption cases in spite of the system working against her.

And so Nepal has arrived as a young democracy trying to build the foundation of democratic rule. Cultural norms are one pillar. The protesters made it clear that a culture of corruption will not stand. Another pillar is an informed public.

If the conduits of information are rotten, then what is worth saving? There is no such thing as a marketplace of ideas. There are money interests that amplify some ideas and that constant competition for attention is a battleground, not a marketplace.
