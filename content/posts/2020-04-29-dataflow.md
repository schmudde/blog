[^canogar]: {-} Daniel Canogar, “Billow,” [Installation at Bitforms](https://bitforms.art/exhibition/canogar-billow/), April 22 – June 3, 2020

 Director Steven Sacks and Art Technician Scott Neal used extreme caution to coordinate with Daniel Canogar and his studio, exchanging virtual advice from New York to Madrid, to make this exhibition possible. Now, we find ourselves faced with a new set of questions: how can we effectively share a physical installation in the middle of self-isolation?

> The data-sphere is a driving force of society and the economy, despite its invisible nature. This lack of visibility can make it difficult to comprehend how information affects daily life. Billow attempts to expose the hidden threads of data networks. Canogar's exhibition consists of six sculptural LED screens that depict abstract animations developed with data from real-time Google Trends. Colors within the animation are determined by how "hot" or popular a specific topic becomes; the more viral the search is online, the warmer the tones become. Popular queries from each day appear momentarily as overlaid text before dissolving into a smoky abstraction. Their lingering forms generate illusions of interlaced imagery. [^cangar-2]
