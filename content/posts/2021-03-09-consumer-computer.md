IBM’s well-funded research initiatives were enviable, but the computing world was converging towards Commodore. Big Blue eventually overtook CBM’s position as computing's sales leader by the mid-1980s by breaking with its own usual practice.1 Both companies held dominant positions until they were overwhelmed by inexpensive PCs built for the ubiquitous Windows/Intel platform.

Large computers figure prominently in most stories about the consumer computer’s pre-history. By nature of their sheer size, they demand large amounts of space and resources in computing collections around the world.

~~California~~ Canada and the Consumer Computer

# The Consumer Computer

Technologies embody the social structures that produce them (Conway's law?, Winner?). Mainframes and server farms both require large organizations to build and maintain their presence. They are centrifugal forces.

At one point, personal computing evangelists told an opposition story that positioned the small computer in opposition to large computing systems. “Computers before personal computers in a sense took away power, but now that you can get your own computer, you get power from it,” opined the influential technology thinker Stewart Brand.[^brand]

[^brand]: "Today", TV programme (NBC, December 18, 1984). Brand fails to consider that those empowered by computers were trained operators. Very little in the way of formal computer literacy or computational thinking. With very inexpressive tools - the computer revolution hasn’t happened yet.

But our everyday reality using the computer does not feel empowering. The rhetoric of pundits, Utopians, and engineers created a false dichotomy between individuals users and powerful institutions that did not account for the prevailing force of consumerism in Western culture. This short essay makes sense of a world where the most valuable new technology companies are built on the bedrock of advertising (Google and Facebook) and shopping (Amazon).

# Access and Expression

The earliest personal computers arrived after the release of Intel’s first 8-bit microprocessor, the 8008 in 1972.

The MCM/70 is the most expressive effort. This small machine came with a typewriter keyboard and a character display.  Far from the vaunted tinkerers and hobbyists in Silicon Valley, this Canadian machine was built to solve practical problems. The machine booted into APL -  a terse but expressive high level language. Mers Kutt thought that having one computer per person would save businesses time; operators no longer needed to wait their turn to input punched cards into mainframes. Nor did they have to rent time on expensive time-sharing services to input and run code.[^mcm]

[^mcm]: cite paper

The MCM/70 was a breakthrough in computing expression. But the machine didn’t take off like the first consumer computers that arrived five years later.

The MCM/70 was completely conceived in relation to the mainframe. It served the same institutional goals. These are not the same aspirations shared by consumers.


> the present-day personal computing reality is the consequence of the microprocessor’s invention coupled with the demand for public access to interactive computing rapidly growing since the beginning of the 1970s.

But what, exactly, were people demanding?


# The California Mythology

On the other hand, much of the California computing culture was formed in opposition to the mainframe. This was a mix of existing counterculture and an emerging hacker culture.

In *Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution*, author Steve Levy offers a historical account which depicts the titular heroes opposite of mainframe “clergy” that mitigate computer access. Young hackers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology were building the first text editors, operating systems, and video games, but the bureaucrats who determined how resources were allocated on campus did not see the value of these experiments.

The hackers saw their mission ideologically. They wanted to make computers easier to use. They wanted to spread useful tools. They wanted to share helpful information. Why should this require permission?

The mainframe, by virtue of its price and size, was only available to a certain class of institutions. But a smaller machine could conceivably place similar information processing power into the hands of the individual. The Valley’s information-as-power rhetoric adopted from the “hacker ethos” still pervades the story of personal computing. From Campbell-Kelly’s authoritative *Computer: A History of the Information Machine*:

> There was unquestionably a widely held desire to bring computing to ordinary people. Computer liberation was particularly strong in California, and this perhaps explains why the personal computer was developed in California rather than, say, around Route 128 [outside of Boston].[^campbell-kelly]

California was undoubtedly a major contributor to the development of the personal computer. But when it came to actually bringing the computer to ordinary people, manufacturers were often headquartered elsewhere. Radio Shack (based in Texas), Commodore (Ontario/Pennsylvania), and IBM (New York) all made best-selling models in the consumer compuer’s first decade.[^apple] After which, the most popular IBM clones came from all over the world.

Most 1970s startups in Silicon Valley were not in a position to deliver a computer to the mass market. This was also true of established mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers like Sperry Rand, Burroughs, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Outside of IBM, all would shrink or collapse after the arrival of the personal computer. These computer companies had the most experienced engineers and the deepest financial resources. But experience selling low volume, high margin mainframes and minicomputers was hardly useful when selling high volume, low margin PCs.

- [^campbell-kelly]: Martin Campbell-Kelly et al., *Computer: A History Of The Information Machine*, 3rd ed. (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013): loc 606.
- [^apple]: The Apple Macintosh and the Apple II are the obvious exceptions. But Apple’s peculiar influence could not be measured in machines sold. The Macintosh never achieved a significant share of the home or office market. The Apple II had a more significant share, but spent its entire existence trailing Radio Shack, Commodore, or IBM in units shipped.

# Back to Canada

Selling a consumer electronic device in high volume is a concern of fashion as much as utility.

The first computer company able to sell millions of computers was Commodore Business Machines of Canada. They entered the market in 1977 alongside of the Apple ][ and Radio Shack TRS-80. These meanings sold fairly well but their purpose was unclear. Apple’a own desperate attempt at finding an application for the consumer computer is laughable today:



Commodore was more successful than Apple throughout the 1970s and early 80s because it was already prepared to delver products for the consumer, not because it was ready to liberate computing from the mainframe.

Also VIDEOGAMES!!


**comparing him to similar figures at this time, all responding to a relatively new demand and new technical opportunities. When you have sketched this background, you can clarify why Tr’s particular character and experience boosted him towards success – along with a few others**

These characteristics of consumer computing end up in the first Commodore computers - the PET itself. The friendly name and futuristic number, the design of the case, to the ease of use - meant to be a mass market machine, even if there was really no strong function to these machines (a trend). The PET was more difficult, in a way, because the function of a calculator, a typewriter, and an adding machine are so direct. But the application of computers was still an unknown. Earlier microprocessor-based computers were for hobbyists "with some assembly required," such as the Altair 8800 from New Mexico, USA (1974/5), or machines to mitigate institutional problems related to mainframe computing, like the MCM/70 from Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1973/4).

The PET was a success, but the blockbuster machines were Commodore's VIC20 and Commodore 64.

On what sells consumer computers with no application? VIDEOGAMES!

Visicalc.. but what about videogames? Vic20 and C64

> Part of the reason for its success is the price, which keeps falling—from $595 at its introduction to $149 currently, for which the consumer gets graphics and sound equal to or better than that provided by m.achines that cost five times as much.

# Conclusion to my Paper

As Elizabeth Petrick points out in *Imagining the Personal Computer: Conceptualizations of the Homebrew Computer Club 1975–1977*, a tension existed between hobbyists that held anticapitalist and countercultural values and those with a more entrepreneurial approach since the beginning of the so-called personal-computer revolution.[^petrick] Women found it difficult to participate in the revolution. After decades contributing to the development of computing, the participation of women suddenly plummeted in collegiate computer science programs towards the end of the century.[^misa]

The 1980s saw a deluge of computer games and educational programs that tended to target boy’s interests.[^pearl] Studies subsequently showed that boys were more actively engaged with home computers while girls tended to be passive.[^fisher] Mentors, salespeople, and experts were mostly men,[^selby] and an image emerged where young boy hackers became the focus and the fashion. They were the face of the aspirational marketing associated with computing – no longer a dehumanizing technology, computers were helping young men build a better future.

But the ills of computing don’t stop at social issues. They run deep to the core of how software works. By 1997 the noted computer scientist Alan Kay claimed The Computer Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet. In this talk, Kay highlighted a handful of transformative knowledge tools from the earlier minicomputer era that are still uncommon on the personal computer – an object oriented illustration program, powerful metaprogramming tools, explorable software objects that are addressable by IP, etc….

Brand’s simplistic view of the world: more women in mainframe computing than personal computing. Our machines have fallen short of our best-engineered plans because they are not the aspirational tools of the hobbyists or laboratory academics. Thankfully they are also not the machines made for the military to exert global force. They are machines made for the consumer by the entrepreneur who seeks to turn a profit. Consumer computing is the dominant form of computing today and Commodore was a pioneering force.

The average consumer today is aware of the benefits and problems that extensive use of computers has brought to the business world, but has very little concept of the functions he can perform or the resultant benefits to be obtained from operating his own, personal, home computer.  Some of these benefits are listed below:

personal pleasure and enjoyment
increased variety of entertainment
time saved
money saved
better financial decisions
increased leisure time
complete security of personal information
elimination of wasted paper, energy and storage space
increased personal comfort
improved standard of living
increased learning ef ciency
increased knowledge of computers and related technology
protection from re, theft, and personal injury
non-verbal communications ability
reduced pollution

The following table provides a perspective of the relative size of the personal computer market as compared to other consumer oriented electronic products. (See Table I)

Apples' overall strategy for attacking (developing?)  this market is to simultaneously maintain a posture of both product and quality leadership.

Commodore secured a deal with the retail giant Sears and Roebuck around the time of the Eaton’s and Simpson’s agreement. The production required more working capital than the fledgling enterprise could raise. Management at Sears put Tramiel and Kapp in contact with a broker at Inter-Provincial Commercial Discount Corporation Limited. The lender offered to factor Commodore’s accounts receivable at “enormous interest.”[^jeden] [^factoring]

- [^jeden]: “[...] die mir Geld lieh und enorme Zinsen dafuer verlangte.” "Was Jack Tramiel Zu Sagen Hat, Geht Jeden Etwas An!", 11.
- [^factoring]: In other words, Commodore would fulfill Sears’ order and issue an amount due in 30, 60, or 90 days. Inter-Provincial Commercial Discount would bridge the payment period by immediately paying Commodore the anticipated revenue. The “enormous interest” was the 2% the Inter-Provincial took of every invoice for each month it was not fulfilled.

While the company’s strategy was not a perfect fit in a world of mechanical products, it would prove its merit with the arrival of more flexible silicon and software.1

For example, the Commodore’s popular Minuteman 3 calculator was ultimately available in at least 15 different versions: Minuteman 3 (made in Japan, had no square root or memory functions), Minuteman 3 Metric (made in the United Kingdom, had a metric conversion key), Minuteman 3B (made in Canada, had memory functions), Minuteman 3MT (made in the USA), Minuteman 3MC (had a vacuum fluorescent display), Minuteman 3P (included a '00' key), Minuteman 3B, Minuteman 3MR, Minuteman 3MWR, Minuteman 3PM, Minuteman 3PR, Minuteman 3R, Minuteman 3R MT, Minuteman 3S, Minuteman 3SR.

The second was that it was an exclusive custom project for Busicom. So Busicom would have to give permission to do this. The first objection I overcame by designing the tester that I mentioned earlier, where I used the 4004 [as a controller]. I used Frohman’s 1702’s -- they were the first EPROM devices, so that they would emulate the 4001-- so that I could build even a one-off system, and I could develop the system with that, and also show that you could do that so that the customer could do the same thing. That was the basis for then figuring out how you market this stuff. I built the tester; it worked; I showed people how to do it.  I showed people that this is an application where you’d use the 4004 as a controller, and it is very effective in doing that, and I convinced them.  And then, as far as Busicom, through my direct connection with Shima, I found out that Busicom was in trouble – financially -- that they were not that competitive with their calculator, because Intel was charging too much.  So I came up with the thought that if I convinced Noyce to lower the price, in exchange for the exclusivity, then we could do that.  And that’s what I suggested to Bob Noyce.  Bob Noyce obviously had to agree, because that’s what he did a few weeks later. I had found out he was going to Japan and I met him on the hallway and I said, “Bob, I heard from Shima that they are having trouble.  But if you want to lower the price, I’m sure that they might rescind the exclusivity, and then we can announce the product.”  And by that time, since I had already solved the problem of usability, all the pieces were there.  And then, a few weeks later -- actually, probably a month later -- after the trip of Noyce, there was an agreement that they were going to do that.  And so, by summer timeframe, the go-ahead of going public with the 4000 family came.  And that’s when a [new] marketing group was formed, within Intel.  And Hank Smith was the manager of marketing for microprocessors, and both Hal and myself, and also Ted and Mazor, worked very closely with the marketing group, to really help out, map out how to go and market the stuff, and so on and so forth.  So, that was what happened.  And by November, 1971, that’s when the formal announcement, the now famous ad: “A new era in microelectronics has arrived,” or something like that, [announcing] a computer-on-a-chip, blah, blah, blah.  So that was the ad that they....

I’m not taking them on, they’re taking me on. […] We are very proud that IBM has decided, after we have over two million computers out there, that there is a home market. They definitely did not lead, they followed.1
