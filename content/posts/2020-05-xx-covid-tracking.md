Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It's not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks. And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can't confirm the app's diagnosis. So the alert is useless.

Similarly, assume you take the app out grocery shopping and it doesn't alert you of any contact. Are you in the clear? No, you're not. You actually have no idea if you've been infected.

The end result is an app that doesn't work. People will post their bad experiences on social media, and people will read those posts and realize that the app is not to be trusted. That loss of trust is even worse than having no app at all.

)Rapid Response: Capacity for Isolation, Contact Tracing,and Quarantinea)The capacity to isolate new cases and trace, test, and quarantine contacts rapidlyb)The capacity to treat new COVID-19 cases effectively, at home or in a hospital


 reasonable first approach is to supportrapid pilot program in some regions of the country that  are  already  supporting  existing  surveillance  capabilities.For  example,  Massachusetts recently  announced a  new  programto  hire  and  train  1,000  people  to  support  contact  tracing. Successful early models and best practices would provide the basis for CDCâ€™s guidance to expand these capabilities throughout the country. Public health workers engaged in this expanded surveillance system will need to be supported by technological  tools  that  help  increase  the  efficiency  and  ease  of  contact  tracing-such  as enhanced   directories,   multichannel   messaging   applications,   real-time translation   services, symptom reporting and isolation monitoring.While  this  surveillance  system  is  critical  now  for  containing  and  mitigating  the  COVID-19 epidemic, the capacities developed for this response would also provide a stronger foundation for detecting and responding to future outbreak


> The  state  and  local public  health workforce will  need  to  be  substantially  strengthened to be able  to generate,  manage  and  respond  to  the  data  from  all  three  surveillance  systems  listed above.This is particularly urgent for the capacity to conduct aggressive case identification and contact tracing. Ideally, when a new case of COVID-19 is identified, local public health officials will assure that the affected  individual  is  isolated,  and  that  their  close  contacts  are  identified  and  asked  to quarantine.  However,  existing  local  public  health  capacity  for  such  response  activities  is  very limited,  and  many  jurisdictions  have  abandoned  contact  tracing  in  favor  of  community-level mitigation measures. To enable a return to case-based interventions as incidence declines, these capacities  need  to  be  expanded.  Improved  capacity  will  be  most  effective  if  coordinated  with health care providers, health systems, and health plans and supported by timely electronic data sharing. **Cell  phone-based  apps  recording  proximity  events  between  individuals  are unlikely  to have   adequate   discriminating   ability   or   adoption   to   achieve   public   health   utility, while introducing serious privacy, security, and logistical concerns.** Instead, timely contact tracing can be achieved through strengthened public health case investigation augmented by technology and community-level collaborations.[^duke]

> The regional surveillance system should develop a sufficient level of local contact tracing and management  capacity  within  the  public  health  system  to  address  expected  contact  tracing needs, based on the potential burden of further outbreaks.Growing this capacity will require training  and  technical  and  financial  support.  The  CDC-led  surveillance  system  funding  should support   augmenting   this   public   health   capacity   in   state   and   regional   authorities,   with accountability  for  demonstrating  that  the  capacity  is  being  developed  effectively  but  with flexibility  in  how  states  do  so.

In Russia, the government has resorted to facial recognition cameras to enforce quarantine orders without guarantees that such technology will not be used for other purposes. In Azerbaijan citizens must report their movements by SMS to an electronic system, potentially enabling the police to monitor them. In Montenegro, the government published on its website the names and the addresses of people who have been ordered to self-isolate upon their return from abroad.

In Poland, a mandatory government-provided app requires quarantined people to take time-stamped selfies with GPS coordinates several times a day. Failure to comply with the task may result in police intervention and lead to a hefty fine. Turkey also announced a similar mandatory app to follow the whereabouts of persons who have been tested positive for COVID-19.

In the United Kingdom, the Guardian newspaper revealed that technology firms processed the confidential personal data of patients without transparency or accountability.
