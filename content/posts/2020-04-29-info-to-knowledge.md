*Information* is a slippery term. It can be emperical or anecdotal. It can imply neutrality even while being overtly politicized. It can feel concrete even as it slips away.[^internet]

[^internet]: It has been claimed that [*the internet never forgets*](https://www.independent.co.uk/student/istudents/the-internet-never-forgets-so-be-careful-what-you-put-on-it-8787706.html), but sites like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) remind us how fragile digital culture actually is.

Information determines many facets of our life experience before we are born. It may even be the [material of reality](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/why-information-cant-be-the-basis-of-reality/).

This blog uses six categories (tags) to give this expanse some shape. The categories are broadly defined because information touches every aspect of experience.

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-tag"></i>#[doing](/tags/doing.html): strategies for living life</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-tag"></i>#[humanities](/tags/humanities.html): cultural objects and art making</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-tag"></i>#[personal](/tags/personal.html): updates about the author</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-tag"></i>#[science](/tags/science.html): conceptual thinking about computing and its impact on society</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-tag"></i>#[suchness](/tags/suchness.html): illusion of reality and the reality of paradox</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-tag"></i>#[tools](/tags/tools.html): specific tools and tutorials</li>
</ul>

Every post on *Beyond the Frame* is written in the context of [internet assumptions](https://stratechery.com/2020/zero-trust-information/);[^assumptions] they consciously embrace the perspective of living in a post-internet age.

[^assumptions]: 1 - Everyone and everything is connected. 2 - It essentially costs nothing to move information around the world; the [marginal cost](https://economicsconcepts.com/marginal_cost.htm) is exactly zero. 3 - Access to information is continuous and distributed. 4 - For better or for worse, no collective legislation or action will return us to a pre-internet socieity.

## The Process of Organizing Information

<div class="epigraph">

I was always equally interested in the humanities and the sciences. As a documentary filmmaker, I assembled a bunch of footage into a coherent narrative. As a programmer[^sicp], I focused on writing small functions that take data, transforms it, and outputs the result [^functional].

[^sicp]: "[A programming language is] a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. The language provides [means] for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas." ~ *[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1)*
[^functional]: Rather than making a *statement* such as `'sky = blue'`, *functional programming* focuses on *expressions* that depend on the information being passed. The function `'sky-color?'` will return `'blue'` in the context of `'earth'` and `'black'` in the context of the `'moon'`. See how the information has been transformed? `'earth` &rarr; `sky-color?` &rarr; `blue'`

Give me a pile of information and I'll make something out of it.

*Beyond the Frame* is an attempt to give form to these thoughts. As Wurman claims in the first section, there are only so many ways to structure information. Katherine Bertolucci summarizes [several methods](http://www.isisinform.com/unlatched-richard-saul-wurman%E2%80%99s-theory-of-limitations/):

- **Sequences** (location, alphabet, time): this blog displays posts in chronological order
- **Groups** (categories, hierarchies): this blog categories posts using tags
- **Shapes** (how something fits in a given area): this blog uses sidenotes

Beyond chronological ordering or hierarchical grouping,[^hierarchy] Bertolucci also offers a more abstract and poetic structure. It is a sequence she calls it a *chain*:

[^hierarchy]: Hierarchies are groups that can also be traversed sequentially.

> Perhaps you are writing a grocery list. Cereal reminds you of milk, which reminds you of coffee, which reminds you of sugar, which reminds you of cookies, etc. In information organization, chains are generally not intentional, but you see them a lot. People post online lists.  They don’t consciously arrange them so they unconsciously put them into a chain.

This blog chains together ideas about information and looks for the material within the links.

## On Being Human

<div class="epigraph">
> On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.

People generate and consume massive amounts of information every day. We organize it as subjective stories and assert objective evidence. Sometimes we even create knowledge.

The process will never be fully knowable. Organizing information helps create connections between ideas and surface new techniques. The overlap between tags on this site, #[doing](/tags/doing.html), #[humanities](/tags/humanities.html), #[personal](/tags/personal.html), #[science](/tags/science.html), #[suchness](/tags/suchness.html), and #[tools](/tags/tools.html) are themselves revealing.

Working with information is good for the mind. Reading broadens horizons. Puzzles and games are joyful. Following a good recipie is nourishing.

Learning how to work with information is good for the soul. This may be an act of engineering, becoming a better reader, or a meditation practice. It transforms information into knowledge.
