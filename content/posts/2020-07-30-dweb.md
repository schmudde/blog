## The DWeb Principles

The theme of last night's DWeb Meetup, *Community Views Around the Globe*, highlighted the 2019 Global Fellows from from India, Brazil, and South Africa. Their on-the-ground efforts use distributed web technologies to bring networked communication to undeserved areas.

Before I get into those details, I'd like to highlight the work of [Mai Ishikawa Sutton](https://maisutton.net/) and [John Conor Ryan](https://www.johnconorryan.com/). They have put together a first draft of *[DWeb Principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NtoS_bSC4qV9cJ6ECFPTY66Qy3jSXWFbUuQDrU-IvQ)* using these three prompts as a starting point:

1. Define the values that bind us
2. Examine *how* - not only *what* - we build
3. Build a basis for mutual accountability

**By establishing common values that are reflected in *how* we build technology,[^how] they feel that we can establish a strong communal foundation in the next internet - the distributed internet -  with mechanisms for accountability.**

[^how]: I really like this idea of *how*. Deciding *what* to build based on solid ethical footing seems like a good start. But if the effort is marred by the exploitation of labor, emotional manipulation, or the threat of violence (the *how*), the end result cannot be inherently ethical.

Establishing and working by a set of values is important. When pioneering new internet technology, people come from all over the world. It takes time to know your peers, but **identifying shared values is a good place to start building trust.**

The resulting document[^manifesto] emphasizes these principles:

[^manifesto]: I have to admit, I love a good manifesto. Favorites include *[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)* by John Perry Barlow (1996), the [Dada Manifestos](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/dada-manifesto) of 1916/18, and [DOGMA 95 - THE MANIFEST](http://www.dogme95.dk/dogma-95/) (&ldquo;Today a technological storm is raging, the result of which will be the ultimate democratization of the cinema.&rdquo;) (1995). The authors of the *DWeb Principles* don't aspire to such dramatic flair.

1. Human Rights
2. Distributed Benefits
3. Technology agnostic
4. Inclusive
5. Respectful
6. Transparent
7. Value for the Environment

Each principle [is detailed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NtoS_bSC4qV9cJ6ECFPTY66Qy3jSXWFbUuQDrU-IvQ) without technical explanation. Much of the rhetoric echos the early web and Brewster Kahle's call to [permanently lock the web open](https://archive.org/details/DWebSummit2016_Introduction_Brewster_Kahle):

> We support the spirit of invention and participation from anywhere, by anyone, without permission from government agencies or from dominant corporations.

On one hand, this seems utopian - **people coming together from all over the world, contributing to a better internet and a greater society, without the active hand of government or corporate interest**. On the other hand, the current internet shows that this is possible.[^wikipedia]

[^wikipedia]: Wikipedia is a shining example. Wikipedia is not a finished product, nor is it a perfect community, but what has been accomplished outside of centralized and monetized efforts is encouraging.

## Starting Offline

The rest of the DWeb meetup dealt with communities which are largely offline. While it may seem counter-intuitive, thinking first about those without access, rather than those with access, takes an expansive approach to the problem of building a more equitable web.

Last night's presenters use distributed web technologies to get people online in low-bandwidth environments - fundamentally valuing a person's individuality while also manifesting their lived networked interdependence.

- Sol Luca de Tena, a director of [Zenzeleni Networks NPC](https://zenzeleni.net/), has created South Africa's first community network. Most recently, she worked on **delivering reliable health information in local languages during the COVID crisis**.
- Hiure Queiroz works on distance learning solutions in Brazil by **leveraging old computer parts and Raspberry Pis to provide robust online and offline solutions**. The machines he and his peers at [Coolab](https://www.coolab.org/) distribute comprise of disused equipment. Together with Marcela Guerra, they use the network to provide educational support for families via the [Associação Portal sem Porteiras](https://portalsemporteiras.github.io/#psp).
- TB Dinesh works outside of India's mega-cities to provide services to rural citizens. The lower literacy rates present a unique challenge. **Getting these citizens connected helps collect the invaluable cultural work of indigenous people while providing a communications gateway to the rest of the country.** Check out the [Namma Halli Radio](https://www.namdu1radio.com/) as an example.
