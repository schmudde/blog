The first popular personal computers came from folks who understood marketing and consumer behaviors. These principles continue to define the industry. Which is why many of the largest consumer computing firms are advertising (Meta and Google) or shopping (Amazon) companies.

# The California Mythology

The mythology of California's personal computer culture is a mix of existing counterculture and an emerging hacker culture.

In *Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution*, author Steve Levy offers a historical account which depicts the titular heroes opposite of mainframe “clergy” that mitigate computer access. Young hackers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology were building the first text editors, operating systems, and video games, but the bureaucrats who determined how resources were allocated on campus did not see the value of these experiments.

The hackers saw their mission ideologically. They wanted to make computers easier to use. They wanted to spread useful tools. They wanted to share helpful information. Why should this require permission?

The mainframe, by virtue of its price and size, was only available to a certain class of institutions. But a smaller machine could conceivably place similar information processing power into the hands of the individual. The Valley’s information-as-power rhetoric adopted from the “hacker ethos” still pervades the story of personal computing. From Campbell-Kelly’s authoritative *Computer: A History of the Information Machine*:[^campbell-kelly]

> There was unquestionably a widely held desire to bring computing to ordinary people. Computer liberation was particularly strong in California, and this perhaps explains why the personal computer was developed in California rather than, say, around Route 128 [outside of Boston].

[^campbell-kelly]: Martin Campbell-Kelly et al., *Computer: A History Of The Information Machine*, 3rd ed. (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013): loc 606.

California was undoubtedly a major contributor to the development of the personal computer. But when it came to actually bringing the computer to ordinary people, manufacturers were often headquartered elsewhere. Radio Shack (based in Texas), Commodore (Ontario/Pennsylvania), and IBM (New York) all made best-selling models in the consumer compuer’s first decade.[^apple] After which, the most popular IBM clones came from all over the world.

[^apple]: The Apple Macintosh and the Apple ][ are the obvious exceptions. But Apple’s peculiar influence could not be measured in machines sold. The Macintosh never achieved a significant share of the home or office market. The Apple ][ had a more significant share, but spent its entire existence trailing Radio Shack, Commodore, or IBM in units shipped.

Most 1970s startups in Silicon Valley were not in a position to deliver a computer to the mass market. This was also true of established mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers like Sperry Rand, Burroughs, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Outside of IBM, all would shrink or collapse after the arrival of the personal computer. These computer companies had the most experienced engineers and the deepest financial resources. But experience selling low volume, high margin mainframes and minicomputers was hardly useful when selling high volume, low margin PCs.

# The Adman

Lewis Kornfeld[^kornfeld]: was a adman turned electronics executive at Radio Shack. His time as the company's president [from 1970-1981](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/business/lewis-kornfeld-made-radio-shack-an-early-player-in-pcs-dies-at-97.html) was an era of tremendous growth. This period saw the introduction of two significant consumer hits: [Citizens band radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio) and the TRS-80 home computer. The latter was announced on August 3, 1977 at New York's Hotel Warwick.[^269] The TRS-80 cemented Radio Shack as a force in early personal computing; by 1980 it had unseated the mainframe/minicomputer[^mainframe] platforms as the most popular platform for video games.

Kornfeld asserts his claim to TRS-80 fatherhood in at least three different places in this book.[^fatherhood] Being first on retail store shelves nationwide[^trs-80] puts him in pole position ahead of Jack Tramiel, Chuck Peddle, and the folks at Commodore[^commodore], Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and the folks at Apple, and William Lowe, Don Estridge, and the folks at IBM.

[^fatherhood]: On pages 61, 262, 330

[^trs-80]: To give a sense of the computer, its cost, and its strengths, here is coverage from Byte Magazine (Vol 2 No 11, Nov. 1977, pg 446): &ldquo;Announced in August, the new Radio Shack TRS-80 is a major entry into the personal computer market. The $599 single board Z-80 based unit comes complete with a full ASCII character set keyboard, cassette recorder and video display monitor. Also included for the price is 4 K bytes of pro- grammable memory and 4 K bytes of read only memory; the latter features a built-in BASIC package.&rdquo; ~ *[The TRS-80: Radio Shack's New Entry](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1977-11/page/n45/mode/2up)* .

[^commodore]: To give a sense of the computer, its cost, and its strengths, here is coverage from Byte Magazine (Vol 2 No 11, Nov. 1977, pg 446): &ldquo;The price of the PET is $595 complete with 4 K bytes of programmable memory. The $795 version features 8 K bytes of programmable memory. All IO connections (excluding the built-in tape drive, keyboard and video display) are made via an IEEE- 488 bus. The PET is an excellent example of the true appliance computer: a neat, self-con- tained graphics oriented package designed for the mass market as well as for the serious experimenter.&rdquo; ~ *[Commodore's New PET Computer](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1977-11/page/n45/mode/2up)* (BYTE Vol 2 No 10, Oct. 1977, p.50),

> [Radio Shack's] TRS-80 personal computer (for which I get fathership credit because when the buck stopped on my desk in 1976 I said "BUILD")

> And it was your claimant correspondent who authorized the design and manufacture of the TRS-80 Model I, and selected its nomenclature, general appearance and first system selling price, even if reconstructed history evokes different claims for different names as time goes by (as created by newer pressures on business journalism).

> Having named, defined and marketed the world's first mass-produced personal computer, the TRS-80 Model I, it was enough, I thought erroneously, to settle for pointing the way and blessing the voyage.

It was unclear what a person might do with a personal computer in 1977. Wherever Kornfeld’s place is in computer history, the benefit of having an ad-man steering the ship is pretty clear. Radio Shack sold a lot more computers than their contemporaries in the early days.

Much of the computing industry agreed with Kornfeld's assessment, "There were no known customers asking for [a personal computer]" therefore "it was impossible to identify typical buyers."[^apple] But Kornfeld was the one to take action. "We had no opening order quantity set beyond what would be needed to buy parts economically, but not less than 1000 were being considered [...] and since all we had was a very rough idea of parts and labor costs, a selling price had yet to be firmed up"[^268]

[^apple]: Apple's 1978 Prospectus struggled to identify any uses to entice investment and pick up their 3rd-rate sales: buy an Apple II to make "better financial decisions," enjoy "increased leisure time," and have "complete security of personal information" with "increased personal comfort."

[^268]: 268

Radio Shack's machine continued to be the best-seller in the marketplace until the arrival of Commodore's Vic-20. Commodore was run by the tenacious Jack Tramiel, who had decades of experience manufacturing and marketing consumer-grade office equipment. Commodore's personal computers would even outsell IBM's machines through the early part of the 1980s.

So yes, an adman (Kornfeld) and a trusted brand (Radio Shack) was a critical part of jump-starting the personal computer industry.

# The Consumer Computer

Technologies embody the social structures that produce them (Conway's law?, Winner?). Mainframes and server farms both require large organizations to build and maintain their presence. They are centrifugal forces.

At one point, personal computing evangelists told an opposition story that positioned the small computer in opposition to large computing systems. “Computers before personal computers in a sense took away power, but now that you can get your own computer, you get power from it,” opined the influential technology thinker Stewart Brand.[^brand]

[^brand]: "Today", TV programme (NBC, December 18, 1984). Brand fails to consider that those empowered by computers were trained operators. Very little in the way of formal computer literacy or computational thinking. With very inexpressive tools - the computer revolution hasn’t happened yet.

But our everyday reality using the computer does not feel empowering. The rhetoric of pundits, Utopians, and engineers created a false dichotomy between individuals users and powerful institutions that did not account for the prevailing force of consumerism in Western culture. This short essay makes sense of a world where the most valuable new technology companies are built on the bedrock of advertising (Google and Facebook) and shopping (Amazon).
