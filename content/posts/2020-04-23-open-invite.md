[^veit] I spend a lot of time making things. I dig deeply into projects and spend hours hacking away - perhaps to a fault.[^open-door] But talking about new approaches, ideas, and idle thoughts is just as important.

<i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> If something on this site resonates as a shared interest, please send me an [eMail](mailto:&#100;&#064;&#115;&#099;&#104;&#109;&#117;&#100;&#046;&#100;&#101;) or find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@schmudde) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dschmudde).

<i class="fa fa-map-o"></i> You may also find me in one of my favorite cities: Berlin, Germany; Turin, Italy; New York City, USA; Chicago &amp; Peoria, USA. We can meetup for a coffee, drink, or a snack. I've been meeting online folks [IRL](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/IRL) since the halcyon days of dial-up BBSes.[^bbs]

Some things I can help with:

- Ethics and computers
- The history of computing
- Buddhist practice in the 21st century
- Creative practice in the post-digital society
- Communicating technical subjects
- Lisp and functional programming

I love teaching! I have lectured and run workshops on all of the above.

Some things you can help me with:

- Feedback, corrections, and discussion related to particular posts on *Beyond the Frame*
- Approaches to digital archiving
- New media/computational art exhibitions and openings
- Effective community activism around art, its presentation, and its preservation
- Sharing books and essays that remain close to your heart
- New modes of music performance

I look forward to hearing from you!

[^open-door]: On working with your office door open vs. working with your office door closed from Richard Hamming's *[You and Your Research](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html)*: "If you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. [...] There is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing not much, but enough."
[^bbs]: A BBS (Bulletin Board Service) was a dial-up service for computers. As a young teenager, I would dial into Zeller Zone at `309-691-5056` and chat for an hour or two. Memorable friends included *Mercedes*, *Bubble*, and *Organ Grinder*. [Over 200 BBSes](http://bbslist.textfiles.com/309/) existed throughout the 309 area code in the 1990s. Exploring *Bear Whiz*, *Metropolis*, *Spinward Main*, *Mental Floss*, and the [Free-Net](http://www.lights.ca/hytelnet/fre/fre002.html) was like traveling to new towns - a chance to meet new people and discover something you hadn't seen before. ![](/img/2020-04-23-open-invite/ans_0000.png) *A typical BBS login screen.
