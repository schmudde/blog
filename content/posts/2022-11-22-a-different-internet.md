## Introduction

Ben's presentation accidentally book-ended the final day at the Biennale Tecnologia in Turin.

The day opened with a reflection on the life of data privacy advocate Stefano Rodotà.[^stefano-rodotà] This sort of policy work has been going on for decades, as [previously covered](posts/2020-06-15-personal-privacy.html) in Beyond the Frame. But Rodotà’s work in Italy was facing particularly strong headwinds from policy makers in the United States. When he became the first President of the [Italian Authority for the Protection of Personal Data](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/garante-privacy-en/the-italian-data-protection-authority-who-we-are) in 1997, the Clinton administration released its *[Framework for Global Electronic Commerce](https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/New/Commerce/)*. This policy essentially abdicated government oversight of a fair and equitable internet in the United States in favor of one run primarily by corporations with a profit motive. Its toothless protection for citizens included this vague parental threat:

> The Administration considers data protection critically important. We believe that private efforts of industry working in cooperation with consumer groups are preferable to government regulation, but if effective privacy protection cannot be provided in this way, we will reevaluate this policy.

In other words, "if you don't keep your room clean there may or may not be consequences.“ Predictably, tech's room is a mess. Just days ago, newly unsealed court documents in a case against Facebook &ldquo;describe data anarchy within the company, where people responsible for data systems are unaware of how other people in the company use their system. In some cases even the engineers using a system may not be able to understand what is happening because, according to a Meta engineer, ‘it is not possible for humans to understand’.&rdquo;[^iccl]

[^iccl]: Findings by the [Irish Council for Civil Liberties](https://www.iccl.ie/news/unsealed-court-documents-reveal-data-anarchy-at-meta/). Why Ireland? Remember that the [Irish Data Protection Commission](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) enforces Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Unlike Clinton, Rodotà felt that there is a place for government in governance. Consider the difference in tenor:

> We may believe that we are only discussing data protection; in fact we are dealing with the destiny of our social organizations. [...] there is little doubt that privacy is a necessary tool to defend the society of freedom and counteract the drive towards establishment of a society based on surveillance, classification, and social selection.

## The Internet is Broken

The day ended with a presentation by Ben Tarnoff.[^internet-for-the-people] Ben offers a vision for the future internet with a different set of ground rules. Most current proposals for the internet's next evolution, often called Web3, are stuck in Clinton-era logic. The aforementioned *Framework for Global Electronic Commerce* conveys a belief that civic governance stops the market's ability to realize the public's needs and wants. Today's well-capitalized Web3 initiatives are often funded by many of the same folks that lead the initial financialization of the web, such as Andreessen Horowitz.

[^internet-for-the-people]: !["Internet for the People" book cover](img/2022-11-22-a-different-internet/internet-for-the-people-cover.jpg) *[Internet for the People: The Fight for Our Digital Future](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3927-internet-for-the-people)* by Ben Tarnoff (2022)

The people who lead the way to a broken internet are not the ones to fix it. Tarnoff laments that the internet is treated like a business and that is exactly why it's broken.[^is-a-business] A more equitable internet - for example one that respects personal privacy - would require a provision for democratic governance and a true notion of common spaces and ownership.[^tribes]

[^is-a-business]: "The root is simple: the internet is broken because the internet is a business." pg 11

[^tribes]: Unfortunately, Cold War thinking has galvanized many readers into tribes that either identify With the free-market libertarians or the committed Communists. This is a false choice. The internet is a big place.

But what exactly is broken? Consider internet access in the United States. The last place I lived in New York City offered me the choice of two providers. When I lived in Peoria, Illinois in the 1990s I had at least 4 times more choices.[^deregulation]

[^deregulation]: pg 35 - 1998, 92 percent of Americans had the choice of seven or more ISPs simply by using a modem over their phone line. But in the aftermath of a 2005 Supreme Court decision that affirmed the Bush-era deregulations, the big ISPs began refusing their competitors access to their infrastructure.

The contemporaneous *Framework for Global Electronic Commerce* promised that "expanded services" and "lower prices" would arise "in a market-driven arena, not in an environment that operates as a regulated industry." Anecdotal evidence shows that this prediction did not come to pass. And the statistical evidence is even more damning. Average internet costs are high and speeds are slow when compared to Europe and Asia. Further, folks in the United States are more dissatisfied with their internet service providers than the much maligned airline companies and the byzantine health insurers.[^36]

While the rest of the world doesn't need to worry about the United States' access problems, they are indicative of what's wrong further up the stack at the application layer. Applications built by Amazon, Facebook, and Google do present immediate global concerns.

It will take years to understand the deepening ties between commerce and information systems. Early studies and anecdotal evidence suggest everything from a confidence crisis in teenage girls to threats to the foundations of Democracy.

I am not prepared to blame social ills on a shifting media landscape. In Kenneth Goldsmith's love letter to the World Wide Web, *Wasting Time on the Internet*, he observes folks with a rich online social life, people deeply engaged with the written word, and children who love both video gaming and playing in the park. Media theorists like Marshall McLuhan saw new media engulf the conventional wisdom of those who were raised in old media more than once. The cycle repeats endlessly: those who swam in old media deride the perceived effects of new media.

What I do feel comfortable observing is the whole cloth replacement of the town square with the shopping mall. Our digital public spaces - often called "platforms" - are really purpose-built shopping malls. This distinction is where Tarnoff's book shines.

The shopping mall's purpose is to drive purchases. We may feel free walking around and speaking our mind within the shopping mall but it is surveilling us at every moment hoping to persuade us to make another purchase. Although this seems tolerable to some, the limits become apparent whenever there is a desire for privacy. As Doc Searls points out in *The Intention Economy*, we do not have a right to contract. We accept whatever terms they offer when we enter the shopping mall. If we do not like the terms, we cannot have a private conversation elsewhere if all our eMails (think Gmail) and texts (think WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger) run through their shopping mall. And if we want to have a public conversation, well that's also within their shopping mall. The explicit trade-off is our data. And if we want more sovereignty over our personal data, it's doubtful that it will pass the terms of service.

This is the completely predictable outcome of Clinton's policies. Tarnoff cites activist Jeffrey Chester warning of "a virtual electronic shopping mall" overtaking the public internet as far back as 1993.

Concerns about the shift from interoperable public spaces to siloed corporate spaces can also be observed in online art from the era. [Galley 404](http://www.netart.today/) features two such pieces. [Toywar](http://www.netart.today/pages/9.html)[^toywar] (1999) is sort of digital performance art that centers on a true-life domain name battle between the etoy.CORPORATION (an artist collective, incorporated in 1994) and eToys Inc. (one of the biggest e-commerce companies, incorporated 1996). [Airworld](https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/airworld.html) (1999) was an advertising-fueled art website that pulled in corporate content from around the internet. Both pieces blurred the line between autonomous expression and corporate control. Their legacy as cultural artifacts are evidence that a different internet once existed, proof-positive that a different internet can once more emerge.
