“How do we recognize the lineage of shravaka realization? Upon learning how to put an end to the individual and shared characteristics of the skandhas, the dhatus, and the ayatanas, the hair on their entire body stands on end, and they delight in cultivating a knowledge of characteristics but not in cultivating an awareness of dependent origination.

Pedagogy Goals


# Knowledge

*Two obstructions*: these include passion and knowledge. Passion is the cause of karmic death. Knowledge is the cause of transformation death. (Red Pine)

Buddhism isn't knowledge. The mind has a way of falling in love with ideas and establishing them as truth. This forms attachment. Rather, knowledge in action as a Buddhist is more like a raft. When you get to the other side, leave the raft behind.

Buddhism is about direct experience, not ideology provided by a teacher. The only truth is in emptiness and it cannot be taught, only experienced.
