# Towards suchness

suchness . The Sanskrit is tathata. Reality. (red pine)

Tathātā (Sanskrit: तथाता, romanized: tathātā; Pali: तथता, romanized: tathatā; Tibetan: དེ་བཞིན་ཉིད་; Chinese: 真如) is variously translated as "thusness" or "suchness". It is a central concept in Mahayana Buddhism[1][2] having a particular significance in Chan Buddhism as well. The synonym dharmatā is also often used.[citation needed]

While alive the Buddha referred to himself as the Tathāgata, which can mean either "One who has thus come" or "One who has thus gone",[3] and interpreted correctly can be read as "One who has arrived at suchness". (wikipedia)

> The dharma body has no attributes but also does not have no attributes. Because it has no attributes, it is the nature of suchness. Because it does not have no attributes, it is the waves of our repository consciousness.

> And what is meant by meditation on suchness? [360] This refers to the projection of the projection of the two kinds of no-self [361] and the projection of the non-arising of suchness. This is what is meant by meditation on suchness.

[360] The Sanskrit is tathata-alambana-dhyana (suchness-based meditation). The object of this meditation is the teaching itself as a projection.

[361] No self among persons and no self among things.

> Mahamati, according to correct knowledge, names and appearances are indistinguishable - like passersby. When the different forms of consciousness do not arise, and they are neither annihilated nor eternal, and one does not end up in the realms of shravakas, pratyeka-buddhas, or other paths, this is what is meant by correct knowledge.50

> Moreover, Mahamati, as a result of correct knowledge, bodhisattvas neither assert names or appearances, nor do they not assert names or appearances. They avoid dualistic views of assertion or denial because they know that names and appearances do not arise. This is what is meant by 'suchness.'

> Mahamati, because bodhisattvas who dwell in suchness reach the realm that is free from projections, they reach the bodhisattva’s stage of joy. And once they reach the bodhisattva’s stage of joy, they leave the false realms of other paths forever and dwell in transcendent realms, where they become proficient in distinguishing the characteristics of all dharmas as illusory, including the characteristics of the realm of personal realization, and where they see their nature as different from their characteristics while remaining free from projections, and where they eventually reach the dharma cloud stage51 and therein the full unfolding of samadhis, higher powers, masteries, and spiritual faculties. And upon reaching the tathagata stage, the light of their various transformations radiates like the moon on the water and brings beings to maturity by teaching them in accordance with their desires and understanding, as they thereby fulfill the ten inexhaustible vows.52 A dharma body that transcends the products of thought, this is what bodhisattvas who dwell in suchness obtain.
