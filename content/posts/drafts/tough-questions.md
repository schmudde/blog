I'm concerned with the way information travels in the 21st century. How do authoritative sources work? How do those in power withhold information while extracting information from the public? How to authenticate information? How does software hide biases in design (both user experience and software architecture)? How does complexity obscure patterns? How does simplicity hide nefarious byproducts? How can individuals be empowered with tools of expressive communication? How can we prevent abuse of communication tools by charismatic fascists? How do intelligent systems distort the flow of information? How does automation obscure its own bias?
