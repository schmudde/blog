I want to help you

Valid information can be both anecdotal (story) and emperical (data).

Challenege: spanning both story and data, pseudo-science like cybernetics.

Looking beyond the edges of the screen. The implications of information. This includes both story and data equally.

I was always equally interested in the humanities and the sciences. The breath of my career makes it difficult to communicate. A lot of thought was put into the structure of *Beyond the Frame*. This has been my job for a long time. As a documentary filmmaker, I assembled a bunch of footage into a coherent narrative. As a programmer, I focused on writing small functions that take data, transforms it, and outputs the result [^functional][^scip].

[^functional]: Rather than making a statement such as `sky = blue`, *functional programming* focuses on expressions that depend on the information being passed. The function `sky-color?` will return `blue` in the context of `earth` and `black` in the context of the `moon`. See how the information has been transformed? `earth` &rarr; `sky-color?` &rarr; `blue`
[^sicp]: *[A programming language is] a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. The language provides [means] for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.* ~ *[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1)*

Give me a pile of information and I'll make something out of it. *Beyond the Frame* is one attept.

I had to give some thought about how to structure this blog's information. Katherine Bertolucci offers [several methods](http://www.isisinform.com/unlatched-richard-saul-wurman%E2%80%99s-theory-of-limitations/):

- **Sequences** (location, alphabet, time): this blog displays posts in chronological order
- **Groups** (categories, hierarchies[^hierarchy]): this blog categories posts using tags
- **Shapes** (how something fits in a given area): this blog uses sidenotes

[^hierarchy]: {-} Hierarchies are groups that can be traversed sequentially.

Beyond chronological ordering or categorical grouping, Bertolucci also offers a more abstract and poetic structure. It is a sequence she calls it a *chain*:

> Perhaps you are writing a grocery list. Cereal reminds you of milk, which reminds you of coffee, which reminds you of sugar, which reminds you of cookies, etc. In information organization, chains are generally not intentional, but you see them a lot. People post online lists.  They don’t consciously arrange them so they unconsciously put them into a chain.

This blog chains together ideas about information and looks for the material within the links. We generate and consume massive amounts of information every day. We organize it as subjective stories and assert objective evidence. Sometimes we even create knowledge.

The process will never be fully knowable. But *Beyodn the Frame* uses six tags will help create connections between ideas and surface new techniques.

## On Being Human

<div class="epigraph">
> On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.

People exist beyond the edges of the screen.


Information is political. Information is the basis of science. Information is the basis of engineering. Information is cultural. Information is concrete. Information is ephemeral.

People need tools to work with information.

The needs of the users: need to know more about information age: where we were and where we're going
The goals of the business: raise awareness of my thinking
The current state of the content: most is in the humanities/tools (beyond the frame) and in suchness (aesthetics)
The strategic future of the content: center around information


- learn about information
    - enjoy (humanties, science, suchness)
    - research: need to know more about information age: where we were and where we're going (humanties, science)
- improve what they're working on
    - learn useful approaches to life (doing)
    - learn useful approaches to programming (tools)
    - break out of static thinking (suchness)
- donate to the author
- hire the author
    - consult (cv)
    - teach/give a talk (cv/talks/art)
    - full-time job (cv)

# Meta

I'm concerned with the way information travels in the 21st century. How do authoritative sources work? How do those in power withhold information while extracting information from the public? How to authenticate information? How does software hide biases in design (both user experience and software architecture)? How does complexity obscure patterns? How does simplicity hide nefarious byproducts? How can individuals be empowered with tools of expressive communication? How can we prevent abuse of communication tools by charismatic fascists? How do intelligent systems distort the flow of information? How does automation obscure its own bias?

> I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
