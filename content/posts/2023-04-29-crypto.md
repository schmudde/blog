These artifacts are the reminants of code-breaking activity. They are like ____

The code-breakers are dealing with more than a mathematical puzzle. They are dealing with the social context of their work. This context provides both clues and obstacles.

*The Gold Bug* (1843) features a simple substitution pattern. But one has to know the frequency pattern of characters in the message's native language to crack the code.

Every line of code-breaking code in *Cracking DES* (1996) is preceeded by punctuation. This book says as much about its time and place as it does about the code it cracks.

# Cryptography

Information Aesthetics was a mid-20th century attempt to quantify aesthetics. It built on earlier research into the quantification and communication of ideas, now known as Information Theory. Aesthetics are a principle concern in communication. Millennia of artists and poets immediately come to mind, but mathematicians, engineers, data scientists, and experts in informatics have all wrestled with aesthetic concerns. Mathematicians vie for a more beautiful proof. Statisticians strive to depict their results more elegantly.

Cryptographers work towards empirical outcomes that have practical concerns. Is the method secure? The pearl is revealed only after the method is broken. Here are three historical cryptographic schemes. Every effort to "open the oyster" is accompanied by aesthetic objects that surface the beautiful patterns which are intentionally obscured by cryptographic techniques.

I happened to read *The Prof's Book* alongside Edgar Allan Poe's short story, *[The Gold Bug](https://poestories.com/read/goldbug)* (1843).

# *The Gold Bug* (1843)

Half of Poe's tale of a manic，desperate treasure seeker is a exploration of a mysterious cryptogram.

    53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);80
    6*;48†8¶60))85;1‡(;:‡*8†83(88)
    5*†;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†
    2:*‡(;4956*2(5*-4)8¶8*;40692
    85);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1
    ;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48
    ;(88;4(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;

The effort to decipher the centuries-old puzzle relies on establishing the language of origin[^kidd] and this frequency chart that appears midway through the story:

[^kidd]: [Spoiler alert] The cryptogram was written on enduring parchment. Adjacent to the message was an image that resembled a baby goat. Knowing that this parchment was related to Captain William Kidd (1654 – 1701), a notorious pirate, the story's cryptologist hypothesized that the image was an English-language pun on the pirate captain's name.

```
Of the character 8 there are 33.
                 ;     "     26.
                 4     "     19.
                 )     "     16.
                 ‡     "     16.
                 *     "     13.
                 5     "     12.
                 6     "     11.
                 †     "     8.
                 1     "     8.
                 0     "     6.
                 9     "     5.
                 2     "     5.
                 :     "     4.
                 ?     "     3.
                 ¶     "     2.
                 -     "     1.
                 .     "     1.
```

This table arranges the characters in the cryptogram from most frequent to least frequent. Overlaying this list with the original message is enough to develop a key for Poe's cryptogram; it is a simple substitution pattern: `8` is `e`, `;` is `v`, etc….

With this knowledge, the first line can be correctly converted from this: `53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);80` to this: `agoodglassinthebishopshostel`, i.e. *a good glass in the bishops hostel*.

# *The Profs' Book* (1940)

The most famous code breaking effort in the 20th century - the cracking of the German Enigma in World War II - also used 1:1 character substitution.[^profs-book] As Alan Turing wrote in *The Profs' Book*, in one particular setting of the Enigma, the characters `DAEDAQOZSIQMMKBILGMPWHAIV` deciphered to `KEINEZUSAETZEZUMVORBERIQT`, i.e. *keine Zusätze zum Vorbericht*.

[^profs-book]: ![](img/2023-04-29-crypto/profs-book.png) These images come from [*The Prof’s Book: Alan Turing’s Treatise on the Enigma*](https://www.kroneckerwallis.com/product/the-profs-book-alan-turing-treatise-on-the-enigma/) by Alan Turing and published by Kronecker Wallis (2021, originally published in late 1940). The original is also available [in the Public Domain ](https://archive.org/details/hw-25-3) licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0 via the British National Archives, box HW 25/3.

This information came from what's known as a *crib* - a small bit of cipher text where both the input and output is known. Up to August 1939, it could be shown that up to 70% of the Enigma cribs used by the English were accurate (pg. 138). But as you may have guessed, this isn't enough information to generate a key for the Enigma. The cipher in *The Gold Bug* relied on simple substitution and symbol manipulation. The Enigma encoding system used multiple rotors, each with an initial setting (the Grundstellung), rotor offset configurations (the Ringstellung), and plug boards settings (the Stecker). In order to decrypt a message, the Ringstellung settings must be known along with the correct the Stecker configuration and the message's unique Grundstellung. With each keystroke - for both encryption and decryption - the Ringstellung's settings advance the mechanical rotors a certain number of positions. This means that the character substitution is set dynamically for the entire message.

<figure>
![Enigma stecker](img/2023-04-29-crypto/enigma-stecker.jpg) https://www.flickr.com/photos/rmh40/9904465194
</figure>

The cribs were powerful tools and the early Enigma used by the Germans was missing important security features such as the Stecker. Many pre-war Polish codebreaking efforts were successful without sophisticated machinery. As Turing explains:

> The Poles found the keys for the 8th of May 1937, and as they found that the wheel order and the turnovers were the same as for the end of April they rightly assumed that the wheel order and Ringstellung had remained the same during the end of April and the beginning of May. This made it easier for them to find the keys for other days at the beginning of May and they actually found the Stecker for xxxxx the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th and read about 100 messages. ~ 135-136

Further intelligence revealed that the Grundstellungen were not chosen at random and that numbers were spelled out in full (i.e. the messages would contain the word *one* rather than the number *1*). Researchers discovered patterns in Enigma ciphertext with this information.

> It was never necessary to make a rack because when the 1938 messages were read it was found that the word *EINS* [the German word for *one*] occurred very frequently. We therefore made a catalogue of the encoded values of *EINS* at every possible starting position, and arranged the encoded values in alphabetical order. The unanalysed catalogue was made by enciphering first `E` at every possible position, then `I`, `N` and `S`. This was done with the automatic typewriting enigmas. ~ 140

As the Germans prepared for war, they added additional security features to the Engima. These additional features lead to a combinatorial explosion. The first *bomba kryptologiczna* (Polish for *cryptologic bombe*) was developed by cryptologist Marian Rejewski in 1938 to help automate key discovery. But it was not enough for the more secure wartime Enigmas. The British researchers were reduced to deriving the proper settings (the key), which "depend[ed] upon taking hypotheses [and] hoping to get either a confirmation or a contradiction."

<figure class="fullwidth">
![](img/2023-04-29-crypto/red-green-kw.png) "Up to this point the crossing out has been done with red strokes slanting up to the right. (Green vertical strokes were used to eliminate repetitions of a constation, red vertical strokes to remove contradicted constatations). From now on for a time we will use similarly slanting green strokes. Up to now we have simply been trying to 'get a start'." Fig 41a., page 43
</figure>

By eliminating certain possibilities, and testing new automation machinery against earlier known Enigma ciphertext, the British researchers were able to generate a reliable system for converting Enigma ciphertext to human-readable plaintext. The researchers developed the Spider and the Machine Gun as prominent compliments to the Bombe. The Spider showed the "permissible wireings" between the different rotors (the Ringstellurng) and plugboard settings (the Stecker) used by the Enigma. One step in the team's process of elimination. After narrowing down the possibilities using the Spider, the codebreakers would rapidly test different settings using the Bombe machine. The process was called "firing" the machine at the Enigma settings to see if a decrypted message was produced. The Machine Gun approach tested as many possible settings as quickly as possible in order to at least partially automate the codebreaking process.

Purpose of Cryptanalytic Hardware

The purpose of the following devices is to perform integer factorization for very large numbers. There exist many methods to factor integers, however it is difficult for these to be feasible – having a reasonable cost, and fast enough speed – to be able to factor such large composite integers (for instance, 1024 bit composites) as are generally used by RSA. There is work done on software, and on hardware to work on an effective method to compute factorization; this presentation will focus on the hardware component.

Bomba

• The Bomba, or Bomba kryptologiczna (Polish for "Bomb" or "Cryptologic bomb") was a special-purpose machine designed about October 1938 by Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologist Marian Rejewski to break German Enigma machine ciphers.

• The German Enigma used a combination key to control the operation of the machine: rotor order, which rotors to install, which ring setting for each rotor, which initial setting for each rotor, and the settings of the stecker plugboard. The rotor settings were trigrams (for example, "NJR") to indicate the way the operator was to set the machine. German Enigma operators were issued lists of these keys, one key for each day. For added security, however, each individual message was encrypted using an additional key modification. The operator randomly selected a trigram rotor setting for each message (for example, "PDN"). This message key would be typed twice ("PDNPDN") and encrypted, using the daily key (all the rest of those settings). At this point each operator would reset his machine to the message key, which would then be used for the rest of the message. Because the configuration of the Enigma's rotor set changed with each depression of a key, the repetition would not be obvious in the ciphertext since the same plaintext letters would encrypt to different ciphertext letters.

• This procedure, which seemed secure to the Germans, was nonetheless a cryptographic error.  Using the knowledge that the first three letters of a message were the same as the second three, Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski was able to determine the internal wirings of the Enigma machine and thus to reconstruct the logical structure of the device.

# *Cracking DES* (1996)

Alan Turing's report on the German Enigma was kept secret for decades (TOP SECRET ULTRA). It was colloquially known around Bletchley Park as *The Prof's Book*. It wasn't until after the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) released a copy in April 1996 that the British National Archives acknowledged its existence.

That wasn't the only seminal book on cryptography to be published in the 1990s. The NSA also found itself involved in the publication of [*Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics, & Chip Design*](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/584) (1998). But in this case the NSA was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to *surpress* the publication of the book's research.[^cracking-des]

[^cracking-des]: TODO: Cover and copyright information.  https://archive.org/details/crackingdessecre00elec

The effort to eliminate legitimate research on cryptography started in the 1970s. Researchers found themselves pitted against two of the most powerful institutions in the United States just because they wanted to share their findings. The NSA and the FBI coupled their pressure on individual researchers with a successful effort in Congress to pass legislation which made it illegal to publish cryptography research electronically, on the World Wide Web or elsewhere.[^lawsuits] This ultimately led to the absurd situation, where they first had to publish their source code as text on paper. If someone were to reproduce the results, the cornerstone of the scientific method, they would have to type the code in by hand.[^BASIC]

[^lawsuits]: Lawsuits supported by The Electronic Frontier Foundation, such as Bernstein v. Department of Justice, were important routes towards exposing the unconstitutionality of this legislation. (citation: 4-1, 4-2, 4-3)

[^BASIC]: ![](img/2023-04-29-crypto/valentine.webp) Typing up programs printed on paper was nothing new. It was commonplace to include some simple BASIC programs in computer magazines of the 1980s. For example, this [February 1985 issue](https://archive.org/details/family-computing-18) of Family Computing via [Paul Lefebvre](https://www.goto10retro.com/p/a-basic-valentine?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fbasic&utm_medium=reader2). But this practice was already antiquated by 1996.

*Cracking DES* is a book about the history of cryptography and the controversy surrounding the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It covers the development of DES, its weaknesses, and the efforts of cryptographers to prove these vulnerabilities. The book also delves into the legal and political battles that ensued, including the role of the government in trying to restrict the publication of research on DES. Overall, it is an informative account of the encryption technology and its impact on society.

*Cracking DES* contained source code and diagrams for all components needed to break the NSA's cipher. But rather than publish the book and the code to the World Wide Web, the Electronic Frontier Foundation opted for an easy-to-scan physical book - making the code easy for a computer to read from the physical page. But why?

> The authors live and work in a country [The United States of America] whose policies on cryptography have been shaped by decades of a secrecy mentality and covert control.

> They pressured agencies such as the Commerce Department, State Department, and Department of Justice to not only subvert their oaths of office by supporting these unconstitutional laws, but to act as front-men in their repressive censorship scheme, creating unconstitutional regulations and enforcing them against ordinary researchers.

The context of this book's publication is as important as the material contained within.

*Cracking DES* is a 272 page volume that was illegal in digital form, but could be used to crack the NIST standard encryption scheme called DES. One "merely" needed to follow the instructions to build the hardware and software.

The DES cracker software was written in C. Like the Bombe before it, this software is created to make many tries at finding a key. The number of tries in the best case scenario is reduced thanks to human intuition. Unlike the work published by Turing, this work does not benefit from a crib.

> This software provides a simple user interface for testing the hardware setting up problems to be solved by searching through the possible keys, and running such searches. We're publishing it to show both people and machines how to control the DES Cracker. [5-1] [^sicp]
