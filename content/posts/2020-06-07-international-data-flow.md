By the 1980s the free flow of digital data across international borders was becoming a concern. United States congress held .[^congress]

[^congress]: United States. Congress. House. Committee on Government Operations.

I came across this advertisement from IBM that ran at this time as well, discussing the commitment IBM had to privacy. In the 1960s IBM became the first company to permit employees access to their personnel files. This seemed initiated by some transgression I could not find and pertains to privacy of employees, not privacy of computers and IBM customers.

Special thanks to James W. Cortada, Senior Research Fellow at the University of Minnesota's Charles Babbage Institute. The institute does have an [oral history interview with John Rankine](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/107604) but the audio is not publically available, nor has a transcript been prepared.
